        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          the summer of '67 I was 19 years old and taking a break between semesters 
          of pre-med at Louisiana State University. It was a time of great upheaval, 
          personal and otherwise. I had abruptly switched majors from engineering 
          to medicine. The switch was dramatic, even careless. My engineer father 
          was not happy. The nation was divided and cities were burning (1,300 
          buildings in one night in Detroit) over civil rights and Vietnam. It 
          was a pinnacle year in that great social revolution referred to today 
          as &quot;the Sixties,&quot; which also included hippies, the &quot;pill,&quot; 
          and sexual liberation, among other things. Peter, Paul and Mary sang 
          Dylan's <em>Blowin' In the Wind</em> and we were hell bent to land a 
          man on the moon, as if the fires of social change needed fanning. Out 
          of all this energy grew a new awareness, that the planet was increasingly 
          threatened by a single species, <em>Homo sapiens</em>. That would be 
          us.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">That 
          summer , amid all the turmoil, I left the safety of my cocoon in south 
          Louisiana for the first time. My only intent was to explore and I had 
          a fortnight to do it. So with a new car and camera, and a hankering 
          to see new worlds, especially of topographical diversity, I headed due 
          north, destination Smoky Mountains. By the end of day one the flatlands 
          of my youth had faded in the rear view mirror and the earth was beginning 
          to buckle a bit. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">On 
          day two I meandered for hours beside a chuckling stream, somewhere between 
          Lookout Mountain and the Great Smokies, nestled in the blue hills and 
          green dales of this hallelujah gloryland. The roads were gentle, undulating 
          , two lanes only, the sort of lazy byways one would wish for to be lifted 
          from Rock City to the Pearly Gates. Change was in the air. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          following days were welded seamlessly, as one peak experience was followed 
          by another, and another. I worshipped in cathedral forests, waded clear 
          mountain streams, and felt of cool, clammy rock. I hiked trails, picked 
          berries in &quot;balds,&quot; bagged a few peaks, and slept with stars 
          and bears. And one day, in that sea of rocky tops, I gained the high 
          ground, hoisted my camera, and snapped a photograph, another first for 
          me. And from that moment on things would be different. </font></p>
