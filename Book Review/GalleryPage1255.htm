          ain't Sea World! Rather it is one of those extraordinary moments that 
          cannot be planned or predicted. The scene is the Silver Banks, 5,000 
          square miles of shallow seas north of the Dominican Republic. A whale 
          sanctuary. No ships allowed. And one of only two places in the world 
          where people can frolic in the ocean with humpback whales (the other 
          is Tonga Island in the South Pacific). Several thousand of them are 
          here to spend the winter, calving and mating. And they are putting on 
          a show, breaching, spy-hopping, tail and fin slapping, and singing. 
          I am on a whale research vessel, to photograph the humpbacks while scientists 
          gather their data.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">With 
          more trepidation than I have experienced in many previous wildlife encounters, 
          I back-roll into the bounding main. This is snorkeling only. Diving 
          bubbles startle the leviathans, and might make them mad. Needless to 
          say I would rather not. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
          mother and calf are resting on the bottom, 50 feet below. I remind myself 
          that humpback whales are gentle giants, but after all big is big. About 
          50,000 pounds in this case! I have little time to consider options, 
          such as jumping back in the boat, as mom and calf start swimming straight 
          toward me. I lie spread-eagle at the top with some idea of how Jonah 
          must have felt. Now she is near. In fact I can almost touch her! My 
          heart rate must be 200. Then magically, with amazing grace, she slowly 
          turns, makes eye contact, and greets me with an ever so subtle smile. 
          For real. As she eases by her giant pectoral fin misses my face by inches, 
          just as she intended. I knew all along we would be friends. In fact, 
          I name her Amazing Grace!</font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          broad bench between a humpback whale's upper jaw is known as the rostrum. 
          These whales have been observed giving their calves &quot;rostrum rides&quot; 
          to the surface so they can breathe. They have rarely been seen doing 
          the same with dolphins, though the purpose of this is not clear. Play? 
          But this behavior has NEVER been reported in humans. Until this day! 
          The rostrum ride in the above photo was repeated many times over an 
          hour or so as this gentle giant &quot;played&quot; with me and several 
          others. When she was done she swam slowly away, disappearing into the 
          depths, leaving unanswered questions and memories of a lifetime in her 
          wake. (Next photo)</font></p>
