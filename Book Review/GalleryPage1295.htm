        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It 
          is called the greatest archeological find of the 20th century, the &quot;pyramids 
          of the West.&quot; It did not take a genius to figure this out. Machu 
          Picchu is the supreme showpiece, a hauntingly beautiful destination 
          in an isolated setting overlooking the Urubamba Valley, at an altitude 
          of 8,000 feet (see above). The Lost City of the Inca sits astride a 
          &quot;saddle&quot; between two perfectly sculpted mountains: Machu Picchu 
          (big mountain) and Huayna Picchu (little mountain, the peak on the other 
          side of ruins in above photo). It is a setting fit for, even intended 
          for, a god-king. This panorama demands comparison-Yosemite Valley, Grand 
          Canyon, and yes, the pyramids of Egypt. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Here 
          in a blanket of textured green cloud forest is an aberration sculpted 
          by the hands of man. But this is no human stain on god's perfection. 
          This is a high point of man's evolution, an &quot;emerald city&quot; 
          carved out of stone and festooned with orchids, alpacas, and aprons 
          of hanging terraces. Machu Picchu-alone, mysterious, and flawless-even 
          the name has an elegant cadence. We are not disappointed!</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Like 
          Stonehenge, the name is a synonym for mystery. History tells us who 
          built Rome's colosseum and why; also Egypt's pyramids and the great 
          terra cotta army buried at Xian, in China. And, too, the Viking huts 
          under sod roof at L'Anse aux Meadows, in Newfoundland. But at Machu 
          Picchu scholars still wander the past. Speculation runs rampant. How 
          did the Inca build this place and why? And why did they abandon it in 
          less than a century after going to all that trouble? At Machu Picchu 
          we feel the allure of a ghost town, the pain of broken dreams, and nostalgia, 
          not just for what was, but for what might have been.</font></p>
