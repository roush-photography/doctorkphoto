        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          attraction between dolphins and people goes back thousands of years. 
          Ancient Greek artists decorated coins, pottery, and walls with their 
          pictures, and the animals appear in Greek and Roman mythology. The Greeks 
          considered the dolphin sacred to Apollo, the sun god. For centuries 
          sailors have considered their presence near the bow of a ship as a good 
          omen. They seem to bond with people and seafaring lore is replete with 
          tales of human rescue by these intelligent creatures. </font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          slither into the lukewarm waters off Roatan, an island east of Honduras, 
          to frolic with trainer Brandy and her flippered friends. It isn't long 
          before we attract a crowd, dolphins zipping all around in their silvery 
          sheen. Soon I find myself eyeball to eyeball with a bottle nose and 
          an impish grin, both of us suspended in hydrospace. They have come to 
          play, like puppies, only wetter. They accept us, pimples and all, with 
          obvious frivolity. I don't know who smiles most, them or us. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It's 
          my last evening in Roatan. Alone on the beach I watch the blending of 
          sea and sky as sunset encircles the island with an iridescent glow, 
          then melts away in a blaze of magenta glory. The sound of waves reaches 
          me in the faintest of whispers. I would pay dearly to own this view, 
          this moment. I journeyed south to join a pod of dolphins in their world, 
          to hear them sing in the sunshine, watch them prance in the moonlight. 
          I have been graced by their benign presence, a kindred spirit at sea, 
          ever smiling at Poseidon, ever cavorting at the bow of our ships. </font></p>
