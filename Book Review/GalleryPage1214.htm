          are trashing the planet and start asking &quot;When are we going to 
          stop?&quot;<br>
          David Brower</font></em></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">My 
          purpose as a photographer is to point out our connection with the natural 
          world to an increasingly alienated audience. The generation now poised 
          to inherit the earth is the first to be so detached from her. For millions 
          of years humans lived as other species, eking out a daily survival from 
          nature, and mindful on some level of how utterly dependent they were 
          on a healthy and abundant world. Virtually all early cultures worshipped 
          nature, to appease the gods and assure continuing abundance. <br>
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          Alas, nothing has changed about this but our perception, distorted as 
          it is by our encapsulation within the cocoons of a modern world-city, 
          home, and workplace. Add to this the illusory world of television and 
          computers and you have a generation for which nature is an abstraction, 
          suffering from what author Richard Louv calls &quot;nature deficit syndrome.&quot; 
          The real world has been replaced by a small screen that we are tethered 
          to for hours every day, frantically trying to fill our pocketbooks and 
          our emptyness. Of course we can't, thus the billion dollar market for 
          prozac et al to soothe our &quot;money-grubbing&quot; souls. We are 
          far healthier, wealthier, and safer than humans have ever been. And 
          more miserable. As Thoreau stated, &quot;If misery loves company misery 
          has company enough.&quot; </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">All 
          species are destined for extinction, and so the days are numbered for 
          us. If we persist with the arrogant notion that we are separate from 
          nature then the lifespan of our species will be shortened. We must recognize 
          that we are a part of nature, and also a force against it, and begin 
          to moderate our ways, to live in harmony with the world around us. <br>

          The fairy tern in the photograph was likely encountering a human for 
          the first time. The scene was Dulce Island, a tiny atoll in the Gambiers, 
          lost somewhere in the vastness of the South Pacific. Dulce is uninhabited 
          and hundreds of miles from any place that is. It is just as far from 
          any international shipping lane. In our 30 days of sailing from Easter 
          Island to Bora Bora, during which we made this stop, we did not see 
          another vessel. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And 
          yet as we made landfall on Dulce, ostensibly to visit the nesting bird 
          colonies, what impressed us most was the trash, the flotsam and jetsam 
          that had been beached by tide and storm. This entire island, a world 
          away from human <font face="Georgia">endeavor</font>, was strewn with 
          the universal &quot;spoor&quot; of civilization. It was a shocking revelation 
          to a shipload of people who had traveled so far to get away from such.</font></p>
