        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The lexicon 
          of photography suggests the power of its influence upon our world. We 
          <em>shoot </em>photos, <em>freeze </em>motion, and <em>capture</em> 
          memories. The photographer <em>seizes</em> from a split second a subject 
          that remains fixed even as time marches on. In the early days people 
          were afraid of the camera, that it might steal the soul on its way to 
          heaven. Few feel this way today, and it's a good thing. Millions carry 
          cameras with them everywhere they go, shooting everyone and everything 
          they meet. Billions of photos have been uploaded to Facebook alone, 
          not to mention other online sharing sites. We post, tweet, and even 
          occasionally print photos, creating a record of our world unimagined 
          a few years ago. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
          volume contains a visual record of my life in photos, the most striking 
          of hundreds of thousands of images made. They record the astounding 
          beauty and wonder of our world, and the species that call it home, including 
          us. These are the pictures that in some way delighted me or told a story 
          that I wanted to share, and make part of that ongoing record of life 
          down here on earth. They are proof that hardly anything goes unseen 
          anymore. Indeed we are all on candid camera. </font></p>

          River on an eight day river run through the Grand Canyon. The canyon 
          is my favorite place in the world. I have never seen anything half as 
          beautiful, and have been there more than a dozen times. </font></p>
