      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
        the broadest sense nature is our home. It includes the oceans and forests 
        which provide us food, climate control, and oxygen etc, and other ancient 
        ecosystems that we are just as utterly dependent upon. And we have shared 
        this home with countless species that have fulfilled as many needs, yet 
        now exist only because of our tolerance and only under our heel. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Until 
        a few hundred years ago much of the world was a wilderness in which man 
        had to be as cunning as his predator and his prey. Eventually he would 
        master them both, and indeed every other species, using his remarkable 
        hands, superior ingenuity, and his tools (weapons and snares). Man not 
        only followed game trails, he could blaze one when he had to. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Nature 
        was the central theater of life for our ancestors, not a playground in 
        which to recreate after a hard week at the office. But for most of us 
        today, nature is indeed that playground, a getaway where we can hunt, 
        fish, hike, swim, pick berries, sleep under the stars, or paddle a canoe, 
        just for fun. We will bake like a reptile in the sun any chance we get. 
        And we shriek with delight in the ocean surf or gaze with wonder on a 
        mountain peak, as if remembering in our mind's eye some prehistoric pleasure. 
        We then return to the office &quot;re-created,&quot; or remade, as the 
        word implies. </font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Bosque 
        del Apache National Wildlife Refuge is one of the premier wildlife photography 
        sites in the world. Sandhill cranes and various waterfowl by the thousands 
        winter in this 59,000 acre refuge along the Rio Grande River in central 
        New Mexico. A mecca for big lens photographers, the refuge, nevertheless, 
        does not feel crowded<font face="Georgia"> except perhaps at dawn and 
        dusk when skies are fiery red and flocks take wing. </font></font></p>
