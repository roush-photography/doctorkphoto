        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">So Martha 
          and her kind belonged to the ages. A victim of man and his unconscionable 
          greed? Perhaps. It's hard to say otherwise knowing the facts. But as 
          we shall see humankind at its worst can change. There is more to this 
          story.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">We've all heard it before. 
          Throughout much of the 1800s the American bison was <em>shot</em> to 
          near extinction. I choose the word carefully as this was not hunting 
          with a &quot;fair chase&quot; or a noble purpose, but mass killing for 
          profit and fun. After skinning, the remainder of the carcass was left 
          to rot on the prairie (occasionally they ate the tongue). In this manner 
          a thundering herd of 50 million bison was thought to have been extinguished 
          by the late 1800s. And then, lo and behold, a small herd, less than 
          a thousand, was discovered in Yellowstone National Park. Could it be-a 
          reprieve?</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">Less well known was a 
          drama unfolding in the southeast coastal wetlands of the U.S.. The snowy 
          egret was suffering a fate similar to the bison, being shot to smithereens, 
          in this case by plume hunters, from point blank range. And the reason? 
          To provide feathers, and even stuffed carcasses, to the fashion industry 
          which then made giant hats for the well-to-do in New York, Chicago, 
          and elsewhere. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">The indiscriminate killing 
          of bison, pigeon, and egret would eventually generate a strong backlash 
          of public opinion. As the 19th century drew to a close, the shoot-em-up 
          mentality of &quot;hunters&quot; in America was being seriously challenged. 
          A conservation ethic was emerging in the nation, championed by powerful 
          new forces. The &quot;big stick&quot; of President Teddy Roosevelt would 
          establish the National Wildlife Refuge system and set aside 230 million 
          acres of wild lands for protection. And a fledgling organization, destined 
          to become the <em>National Audubon Society, </em>would serve as a strong 
          advocate for wildlife. Things were getting serious. (next photo)</font></p>
