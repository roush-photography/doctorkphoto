          Xanadu did Kubla Khan<br>
          A stately pleasure-dome decree:<br>
          Where Alph, the sacred river, ran<br>
          Through caverns measureless to man...<br>
          Samuel Taylor Coleridge</em></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          grand scale of exploration today, best exemplified by America's race 
          to the moon with the Soviet Union, is to be compared with adventures 
          of yore. And no tale has ever been better told than the adventures of 
          Marco Polo in his <em>Description of the World</em>, written years after 
          his return from Asia. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          year was 1271. Seventeen year old Marco departed Venice with his father 
          and uncle, taking dead aim on the &quot;sunrising.&quot; He would not 
          return home for 24 years, at the age of 41. The threesome traveled by 
          caravan along ancient trade routes, through Turkey, Iran, Central Asia, 
          and finally China, to reach the threshold of the great Khan empire, 
          the Taklimakan Desert. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For 
          nearly a year they struggled across the desert, riding Bactrian (two-humped) 
          camels, as visitors still do today. This is a windswept realm where 
          precipitation is one half inch in a wet year, and the parched look is 
          relieved only by an occasional clutch of scraggly poplars. Imagine our 
          hero's excitement when the &quot;pleasure dome&quot; of Xanadu, their 
          long-sought destination, appeared on the distant horizon. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">They 
          had arrived in Shangdu, a.k.a. Xanadu, the summer capital that Kubla 
          Khan had decreed in Mongolia. And well had he decreed, as Shangdu in 
          Mongol means &quot;City of 108 Temples.&quot; Coleridge's opium-induced 
          description of the place was right on. The Polos were certainly humbled 
          in the presence of the Great Khan, &quot;the richest man in people and 
          treasure there ever was,&quot; ruler of an empire that stretched across 
          China, Russia, and Iraq. But as Marco recounts, their first audience 
          at court was unmagisterial, Kubla greeting them with small pleasantries: 
          &quot;Welcome, gentlemen. How was the trip?&quot; They liked him so 
          much they hung around for 17 years.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          1295 the Polos finally staggered home to Venice, where they had long 
          been given up for dead. They were clad in rags and exuded offensive 
          smells. The tattered trio was, nevertheless, embraced by the town. They 
          must have been given a grand reception, perhaps a 13th century Venetian 
          version of a ticker tape parade. Just like the astronauts in 1969!</font></p>
