        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          inaugural Earth Day took place on April 22, 1970 and much has changed 
          in the four plus decades of celebration since. Intended as a &quot;teach 
          in&quot; to infuse the spirit of the fractious <em>sixties </em>into 
          the nascent environmental movement, what transpired was Earth Day, the 
          greatest nationwide street demonstration since the end of WW 2. The 
          intent was to get the &quot;movement&quot; moving, which it did. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          most immediate aftermath of April 22, 1970 took place in the law books. 
          A tougher Clean Air Act cleared Congress that year, to be followed by 
          a Clean Water Act, a Marine Mammal Protection Act, an Endangered Species 
          Act, a Safe Drinking Water Act, and a Toxic Substances Control Act, 
          among scores of others. By years end even the skeptics began to concede 
          that the fallout from Earth Day would be felt for years to come. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          long term aftermath was more subtle. Fears of early organizers that 
          initial enthusuasm would fade were unfounded. Earth Day jump-started 
          a movement which evolved over time into a mind-set. Environmentalism 
          is now more a way of life than a &quot;movement,&quot; its jargon woven 
          into the national vocabulary, its practice part of our culture. Surveys 
          show that 90% of Americans consider themselves environmentalists. Earth 
          Day has taught us what our native brethren knew intuitively. As Chief 
          Seattle so eloquently stated: &quot;The earth does not belong to man; 
          man belongs to the earth. Whatever befalls the earth befalls the sons 
          of the earth. This we know.&quot;</font></p>
