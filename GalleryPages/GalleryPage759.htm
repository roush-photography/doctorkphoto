        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
          is a volume of words. The spoken and written word have plotted the course 
          of human history. We think in words and then we write and act upon our 
          thoughts. Consider the influence on human society of the Bible, the 
          Koran, Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, or a sonnet by William Shakespeare. 
          President Kennedy, speaking at Amherst College, said it this way in 
          one of his last speeches: &quot;When power leads man toward arrogance, 
          poetry reminds him of his limitations. When power corrupts, poetry cleanses.&quot; 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          this is also a volume of photographs. Edgar Allen Poe stated in 1840 
          that photography was the greatest scientific advancement of his day. 
          Hard to argue that. And then science begat art and no art form transforms 
          human apathy more than photography. Glance at any collection of historical 
          photographs: the mushroom cloud over Hiroshima, shootings at Kent State 
          University, the Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk, or perhaps the most iconic 
          photograph of all time, <em>Earthrise</em>. We absorb the message of 
          these powerful pictures and they move us. Empathy and insight come together 
          at once and we are changed. We want to cheer or we want to change the 
          world and bring about a better day.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It 
          is quite remarkable when a picture of a starving child in Biafra is 
          followed by food shipments from around the world. Remarkable too when 
          the image <em>Massacre at Sharpeville</em> mobilizes world opinion against 
          apartheid in South Africa. Or when <em>Earthrise, </em>man's first look 
          at his tiny blue home from space, changes his perception of the planet, 
          from big world to small world. This then is the power of photography.

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Untouchables, 
          or Dalits, the lowest of the Hindu caste system, comprise 15 percent 
          of India's population. They are considered dregs, polluted, and do only 
          the filthiest work. They live separate from the rest of Hindu society 
          and are not allowed to enter temples or take water from local wells. 
          Even their shadows are forbidden to touch other Hindus. Gandhi tried 
          to change all this with little success. One might say if Gandhi can't 
          do it, no one can. But then Gandhi would never give up. Perhaps this 
          is the image that will end the caste system. </font></p>
