        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Prior 
          to the mass migration along the Oregon Trail, only a few intrepid explorers 
          had braved the wilds of the Pacific Northwest. One of the first to do 
          so was a young Scottish botanist named David Douglas, lured to the region 
          in 1825 by the promise of new species and hence riches from the Royal 
          Botanical Society. For over a year he wandered the Cascades, a pack 
          on his back, a gun over his shoulder, and a shaggy dog at his heels. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Climbing 
          the western slopes he happened upon one of the world's great forests, 
          dominated by a magnificent conifer that grew up to 200 feet tall and 
          attained a circumference of 45 feet. At the time it was the new world's 
          grandest tree, the sequoia as yet undiscovered. In those days there 
          were millions of them, from tidewater to glacier toe at 7,000 feet, 
          mantling hillside like textured velvet. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          Douglas Fir, as the tree came to be known, was an icon, unrivaled lord 
          of the northern forests. Sadly, most of those trees are gone now, felled 
          by the chainsaw to build homes and furniture for settlers pouring into 
          the region by way of the Oregon Trail. This practice continued well 
          into the 20th century. The only thing to slow the loggers down was lack 
          of trees. Like Easter Island. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
          second icon was exterminated more recently from this area. Lewis and 
          Clark described the <em>griz</em> in their journals, indicating a deep 
          respect for these formidable beasts. They were chased several times 
          by bears that were mortally wounded. One, in particular, was shot 10 
          times in the chest, yet continued to pursue them for 20 minutes before 
          it finally dropped dead. Much to the shocked explorers relief.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
          hundred years ago thousands of grizzlies prowled the Pacific Northwest. 
          But like the Douglas Fir they are gone now, victims of a systematic 
          extermination program by men who wanted to rid their world of danger. 
          So they shot the bear and built cars, highways, and nuclear power plants.
