        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Belugas 
          whales are at home amid the jumbled blocks of sea ice in Arctic waters. 
          Like seals and bowhead whales they can meander under the pack ice and 
          manage, most of the time, to find air in a maze of natural fissures. 
          When the need arises, though, they can create their own breathing holes. 
          Belugas have no dorsal fin, which would be an encumbrance under the 
          frozen sea, but do possess a fibrous dorsal ridge which can be used 
          to &quot;pound&quot; a hole in the ice above. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Perhaps 
          100,000 beluga whales range around the top of the globe. Those in North 
          America are best known. As the sea congeals in winter the whales swim 
          south, in advance of the ice, to the Bering Sea in the west and well 
          down the coast of Greenland in the east. Then, in spring, as the ice 
          breaks up, the great procession is reversed. They head north to congregate 
          in river estuaries, where they calve, mate, molt, and feed on fish and 
          squid. If they can steer clear of polar bears, killer whales, and human 
          hunters a beluga whale will live about 30 years during which a female 
          might rear five young. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
          century ago the prognosis for beluga whale survival was guarded. Scottish 
          whalers discovered a proficient way of killing the little whales. They 
          &quot;herded&quot; them into shallow inlets at high tide, then blocked 
          escape with their flotillas. The whales never stood a chance as hundreds 
          were stripped of hide and blubber, to be sold as leather, oil, and soap. 
          One infamous hunt, in 1894, recorded the slaughter of 820 belugas. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Fortunately, 
          commercial whaling has been under a moratorium, established by the International 
          Whaling Commission, since 1983. This has allowed a marginal recovery 
          of several species, including the beluga, that were threatened or endangered. 
          Sadly Japan, Norway, and Iceland continue to hunt in violation of the 
          I.W.C., with no purpose other than to satisfy their elitist taste for 
          &quot;exotic&quot; meat. </font></p>
