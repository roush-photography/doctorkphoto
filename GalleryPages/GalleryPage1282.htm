        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For 
          more than a month I pondered Indonesia while tramping the sultry outback 
          of her unwieldy geography. I hiked the central highlands of Papua and 
          felt the palpable tension between native Dani and the transmigrants 
          from Java; I drove to Yogyakarta, the ancient Javanese capital, to visit 
          Borobudur, the largest Buddhist monument in the world; I cruised the 
          Sekonyer River of Kalimantan to Tanjung Puting National Park for a glimpse 
          of the endangered orangutan; I came face to face with a giant dragon 
          on Komodo Island; and I visited the isolated Christian enclave of Tana 
          Toraja on Sulawesi, to witness some of the most elaborate celebrations 
          of death on the planet. Day after day I was struck by the seeming impossibilities 
          of this complex island nation.</font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">On 
          my last day in Indonesia I relax and sip tea on the veranda of my room 
          in a Jakarta high rise hotel. Suspended inches above a calm eastern 
          ocean is a consolidation of brooding, pastel purple fog, made heavier 
          by industrial fumes from nearby. Occasionally the sky is split by a 
          flash of heat lightning, that strangely silent atmospheric tantrum. 
          Off in the other direction sprawls the megacity, the heartbeat of Indonesia, 
          crawling with cars and blanketed by the smoggy soup they exhale (no 
          converters here). But who's noticing? All those cars spell progress 
          to this poor nation. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As 
          I sat in the twilight I wondered if Indonesia could do it, hold together 
          because they wanted to, not, as in Suharto's day, because they had to. 
          This will require sweeping changes to foster an attitude based on respect 
          for human rights regardless of ethnicity or religion. My impression 
          is that it will be a struggle, but Indonesia will muddle through, and 
          maybe someday even live up to their high-minded founding motto:<em> 
          Unity in diversity</em>.</font></p>
