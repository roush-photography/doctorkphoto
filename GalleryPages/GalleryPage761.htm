          I am a baby boomer, one of that mass of 75 million people born between 
          1946 and 1964. Damn proud of it too, as are most boomers. As if that 
          weren't enough, I'm also a tree-hugging, granola-crunching flower child 
          of the sixties, having &quot;come of age&quot; in that lively decade, 
          with all the implications. I was 12 years old in 1960 when JFK became 
          president and 15 when he was killed in Dallas, one of the best and one 
          of the worst days of my life. Like most boomers I remember November 
          22, 1963 like it was yesterday, even more than cowering under my school 
          desk during the Cuban missile crisis. Like a school desk was going to 
          help! </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Baby 
          boomers have been called the generation that changed the world, for 
          better, or worse. We enjoyed (and still do) our day in the sun. And 
          what a lineup, a Who's Who and What's What of people, places, and things, 
          like Elvis, VW Beetles, and Woodstock. Oh, and those other Beatles too. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
          boomers have been marked by the murder of our leaders. We lived through 
          the Cold War, Vietnam, the bloody struggle for civil rights, women's 
          rights, and environmental sanity, and even sex, drugs, and rock and 
          roll. No wonder we're in therapy! But as the dust settled in latter 
          years, behold, a better world. Finally we could laugh at Archie Bunker 
          and Fred Sanford, and really &quot;get&quot; them at the same time.
