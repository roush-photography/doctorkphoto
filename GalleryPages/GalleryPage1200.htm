        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Glorious 
          spring has arrived in North America. After spending the winter hunkered 
          down on evergreens in central Mexico, monarch butterflies are taking 
          to the airways and heading north, as they have for epochs. Successive 
          generations will relay across Mexico, the U.S., and finally Canada by 
          early autumn. In the process each generation completes its life cycle 
          (egg, larva, pupa, adult) in 40 days or so, then dies, passing the baton 
          to the next group of newly emerged adults, which then flies further 
          north. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Then, 
          almost magically, fading light and cool air announce the fall. Leaves 
          turn and every monarch butterfly does the same, doing an about face 
          to head south for the winter. They flutter across thousands of miles 
          to finally roost in the same evergreen forests their ancestors did, 
          six months and multiple generations ago! Truly amazing, and that's not 
          all. This migratory generation is not limited to a 40 day lifespan. 
          It will survive, not only the southbound flight of up to 3,000 miles, 
          but four months of winter torpor, and two months of the return north. 
          About eight months in all! It is during the springtime journey north 
          that they mate to jump start the whole cycle again. No doubt one of 
          nature's epic performances. And not a scientist anywhere has a clue 
          how they do it. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But everyone's 
          favorite insect is in serious trouble. Monarch butterfly populations 
          in eastern North America have plummeted by 90% in the past two decades, 
          from historical highs of one billion in 1995 to 30 million in 2014. 
          But this iconic butterfly's popularity just might save it. People are 
          taking notice, including those at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
          who are reviewing a petition to list the monarch as an endangered species. 
          An unprecedented &quot;Tres Amigos&quot; summit convened President Obama, 
          President Nieto of Mexico, and Prime Minister Harper of Canada last 
          year in Toluca, Mexico to consider the plight of the monarch butterfly. 
          The White House subsequently called a meeting of scientists and conservationists 
          to discuss declining pollinators, focusing on bees and monarchs. Sixty 
          groups, government and private, were represented and charged with creating 
          a federal strategy to deal with the crisis. And U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
          and the National Wildlife Federation signed a historic agreement to 
          collaborate on behalf of monarch butterfly conservation. But will it 
          be enough? </font></p>
