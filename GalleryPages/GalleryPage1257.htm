        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Climbing 
          Mt. Shuksan is interesting on many levels. I should know. I stood atop 
          her serrated summit (far distance) recently, climbing through the clouds 
          on my way to the summit. In doing so I had to deal with empty air<em>, 
          </em>thousands of feet of what climbers nonchalantly refer to as &quot;exposure&quot;-a 
          downplay on words to say the least. Many times I found myself clinging 
          to rock or ice with white-knuckled fingers and toes, whispering the 
          mantra &quot;Don't look down!&quot; Occasionally I cheated and looked 
          anyway, which resulted in whiter knuckles and soft whimpering.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          don't want to overstate my climbing abilities. I was well guided on 
          this ascent. I always go with someone who can catch me (on this occasion, 
          her name was Georgie). And, per usual, as I stumbled my way to the summit 
          in unheroic fashion in Georgie's shadow, I felt pretty damn good about 
          it. And even better when we made it back down in one piece.</font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">My 
          climbing partner, Tom, and I ascended Mt. Shuksan in 1998 as training 
          for Cerro Aconcagua in Argentina, the highest peak in the western hemisphere, 
          which we planned to summit for the new millenneum. Prior to the Shuksan 
          ascent, we spent two days in &quot;snow school&quot; learning to climb 
          safely on snow and glacial ice. Part of that training was crevasse rescue 
          , which required that we prusik (a special climbing device) our way 
          out of a deep chasm in the glacier, under the watchful eye of our instructor.
