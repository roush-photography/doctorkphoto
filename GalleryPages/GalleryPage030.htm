    <td colspan="2"> <div align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        Colorado is one of the world's great rivers. It travels from mountain, 
        across plateau and desert, and finally to the sea at the Gulf of California, 
        a distance of over a thousand miles. Over the millennia the river's tumbling 
        torrent has carved the magnificant, 277 mile long and one mile deep chasm 
        that is Grand Canyon. Calling it &quot;absolutely unparalleled,&quot; 
        President Teddy Roosevelt declared the canyon a national monument in 1908. 
        Eleven years later it became a national park, giving it full wilderness 
        status to protect it from the heavy hand of man. </font> </div>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It 
        didn't work. More than seven million people visit the canyon each year, 
        making it the second most popular park in the country, and the world for 
        that matter, after the Great Smoky Mountains. This volume of foot and 
        auto traffic has wreaked havoc on plants, wildlife, and natural features, 
        which is inconsistent with the mission statement of the National Park 
        Service-&quot;to preserve the parks in a state of wilderness.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
        new and experimental phase of preservation is currently on the drawing 
        board for Grand Canyon National Park. For the first time in its long history 
        the NPS has mandated that visitation be restricted in one of its parks. 
        This will be done using several innovative methods, and hopefully serve 
        as a model for other parks in the future. The goal is to provide a more 
        quality experience for people to gaze nearly a mile down at the roily 
        river, to hike in solitude along backcountry trails, or to feel humbled 
        while shooting the rapids of the mighty Colorado.</font></p>
