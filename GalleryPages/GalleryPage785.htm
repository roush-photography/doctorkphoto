        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
          trickle-down effect from the 1905 murder of Guy Bradley, a Florida game 
          warden working to protect wading birds from plume seekers, was passage 
          of the Migratory Bird Act in 1913. This act declared that birds flying 
          across state lines were interstate commerce and thus subject to federal 
          rather than state regulation. Lax state hunting laws were overturned, 
          uniform game limits were set, and hunting during spring and at night 
          was banned. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          legislation later took a dramatic step forward when, in 1934, duck stamps 
          were required for waterfowl hunters, and a few years later an excise 
          tax was levied on guns and ammunition. The modern era of wildlife management 
          had begun. Ninety-eight percent of these dollars have since gone to 
          wildlife management. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">All 
          this effort would be too late for some species, game and otherwise. 
          Most notable, perhaps, was the passenger pigeon, once the most plentiful 
          bird species on the planet. With the death of Martha, in 1914, at the 
          Cincinnati Zoo, the species faded into history, the first extinction 
          ever to be witnessed &quot;live.&quot; The Pullitzer Prize winning cartoonist 
          J.N. &quot;Ding&quot; Darling, who would later found the National Wildlife 
          Federation, commented on the turbulent times, &quot;The great flocks 
          of wild game which once darkened the skies now cast hardly a shadow.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          the 1920's, along the Grand Canyon's north rim, a game management failure 
          taught some additional hard lessons. Mountain lions, bobcats, and coyotes 
          were systematically eliminated from the Kaibab Plateau by a predator 
          control program. The results was an ecological catastrophe, not understood 
          at the time. There was an explosion of the local deer population with 
          subsequent ravaging of natural vegetation. Eventually large numbers 
          of deer began to die of starvation in the winter as nature tried in 
          vain to reset her delicate balance. The conventional view of game management-that 
          setting aside reserves and removing predators would create wildlife 
          havens for hunters-was open for serious debate. But some minds are hard 
          to change.</font></p>
