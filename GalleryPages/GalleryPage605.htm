        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">An 
          amazing diversity has evolved since life began in the swishing tide 
          pools of a fledgling earth. Tropical and temperate zones are teeming 
          with species, many still awaiting discovery. Even near the poles the 
          oceans boil with fantastic forms, frolicking, feeding, and being fed 
          upon. And yet, as constant as things seem to us, few of today's species 
          would be recognized by those that lived even a short time ago, say a 
          million years. In fact, 99.9% of all species that ever lived have died. 
          Gone extinct. As sure as the individual lives and dies so too does his 
          kind. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And 
          yet death of an individual or a species is not a bad thing. It is part 
          of the natural order and necessary to create a niche for new species, 
          better adapted to a changing planet. In fact, without a mass extinction 
          event we would not be here. For 100 million years dinosaurs dominated 
          the earth with little challenge. Slinking in the shadows, however, was 
          a group of small, hairy, and unassuming creatures, trying to stay out 
          from underfoot. And then along came an asteroid and everything changed. 
          Giants tumbled and the mouse roared. Without the bully reptiles these 
          mammal precursors had room to flex their own might, primarily an expanding 
          forebrain, and eventually an upright posture and opposable thumbs. And 
          flex they did, until finally we came along, <em>thinking and grasping 
          </em>our way to the top. The apex predator. It is sobering to consider 
          that without the ashes of an asteroid, the greatest force in history, 
          human intellect, might still be a universal thought.</font></p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Pinnipeds 
          (seals and sea lions) were slaughtered for food and oil for hundreds 
          of years, to near extinction in many cases. They are a good example 
          of how protection from overharvesting can save species. (next photo)</font></p>
