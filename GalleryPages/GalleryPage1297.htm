        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia">I am on horseback at Caiman Ranch in 
          the Pantanal of Brazil. My horse postholes through sucking mud and wades 
          across shallow ponds. Before long, both horse and rider are covered 
          with a slurry of sweat and mud. Still it's two hours before we stop 
          and dismount at our destination, a forested island with a rank odor. 
          What brings us here is a bloated, putrid carcass of a cow, the only 
          signs of life the wriggling maggots. Yesterday this was money on the 
          hoof. Today it's a jaguar kill and still money, though not on the hoof. 
          How so?</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">Jaguar kills are not 
          news in these parts. Ranchers are typically alerted by buzzards circling 
          overhead. A professional jaguar hunter with hounds is called to the 
          rescue. The cat runs, followed by the relentless hounds. Eventually 
          the weary feline takes to the trees to escape the dogs, whereupon it 
          is unceremoniously shot and left to rot where it hits the ground. Sad? 
          It depends on your point of view. Illegal? Definitely, but so what? 
          This is a big place with few people and less law enforcement. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">But things are different 
          now. Conservation groups, in an effort to save the endangered cats, 
          will now pay ranchers for confirmed kills. Caiman Ranch gets a check 
          for the dead cow and in return the jaguar gets to live. And the rancher 
          even gets a bonus.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">Cattle ranches of the 
          Pantanal are building bunkhouses, but not for gauchos. They're for ecotourists. 
          Adventure travelers will pay big bucks for the chance to see a wild 
          jaguar, and they stay on the ranches since that's where the jaguars 
          are. And the charismatic cats are much easier to see these days since 
          they're no longer dodging bullets. So more ecotourists see more jaguars 
          and go home happy and refer other tourists. Win-win. Ecotourism may 
          indeed be the salvation of a way of life in the Pantanal, and of habitat 
          for the jaguar and associated species.</font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">Dense, steamy jungle 
          lines both sides of the Pantanal River. I drift along with the silent 
          current. The boat rounds a bend and vegetation opens slightly to reveal 
          a sandy bank and this magnificent jaguar, apex predator of these parts. 
          He gazes intently at a caiman in the distance, remaining frozen for 
          nearly a minute while I snap photos. Then, apparently deciding the caiman 
          is not worth the effort, the jaguar steals away into the forest. </font></p>
