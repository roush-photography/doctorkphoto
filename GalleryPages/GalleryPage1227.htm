          Meriwether Lewis-from his journal</font></em></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          drive into a gathering Kansas gloom, aimed in a westerly direction, 
          in search of the American West. Evening clouds are low and swift, yet 
          soft, not unfriendly at the moment, though they can get that way in 
          a hurry in these parts. The landscape is a sea of grass, cultivated 
          of course, as expected in the Wheat State. What I didn't expect was 
          to find it strangely beautiful. Intriguing too, knowing that somewhere 
          out there were Superman, Dorothy, and Toto, Kansans one and all. A splatter 
          of raindrops on the windshield awakens me from my reverie. Large, irregular 
          drops climb up and ride hard on the back of September's wind. I seek 
          refuge from the weather and the night. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          next day dawns bright, chock full of sunshine and blue sky. I visit 
          several towns that all look aglow with cleanness and prosperity, quintessentially 
          American. The downtowns seem frozen in perpetual 1958. I walk the squares 
          and strangers tip their hats and smile. Cars cruise by with Buddy Holly 
          on the radio. Streets are leafy and lazy, more or less perfect, like 
          Mayberry. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Just 
          this side of Dodge City a transition takes place. Folks stop wearing 
          overalls and straw hats and don instead the cowboy hat and boots, signatures 
          of machismo in these parts. The cowboy doesn't walk, he rambles. His 
          expression is a sneer instead of a smile, as if all strangers lack manhood 
          and need to be taken down a notch. Could it be? I believe it is-the 
          American West. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Westerners 
          like to shoot things. When the white man first arrived on the prairie, 
          there were about 50 million bison lumbering around, chewing their cud, 
          like cows with the bighead. Imagine what a difficult target they made 
          as hunters shot them full of holes from point-blank range. For their 
          hides, and for the fun of it. In less than a century there were only 
          a thousand or so left, hiding out in Yellowstone Park. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Then 
          cowboys took to shooting Indians, more of a challenge, since sometimes 
          they shot back. But the Indians didn't have as many bullets, so in time 
          their numbers dwindled too, from a couple of million to a hundred thousand 
          (in fairness to all cowboys, most Indians died from germs, not guns). 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          government finally stepped in and made it illegal to shoot bison and 
          Indians, and relocated them to preserves where they were safe. Or at 
          least safer. Thankfully, both have made a modest recovery without lead 
          poisoning. So Westerners today are left with little to shoot but themselves 
          and the occasional stray liberal. </font></p>
