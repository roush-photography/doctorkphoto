          spends the winter, and hell spends the summer.<br>
          Local saying<br>
          </font></em></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Time 
          to inspect the garden. I refer here to the garden that surrounds me 
          to distant hills, and beyond to the Santa Catalina Mountains. I hoist 
          a small pack containing bread and water, essentials for desert exploring, 
          and hit the trail. The wind blows sand into my eyes and teeth, but also 
          brings the scent of spring in the high desert, more than adequate compensation 
          for my troubles.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          Certainly the most stunning of desert flowers rightfully belongs to 
          the cacti: hedgehog, saguaro, fishhook, and the others. The sundry cactus 
          flowers have earned this high praise based on their large size, brilliant 
          colors, and their ephemeral nature, often appearing for only a single 
          day each year. This transience adds to their charm, in the manner of 
          a rare jewel. And the insects, at least, agree with me. Seldom are these 
          blooms without company, a honeybee or bumblebee wallowing inside the 
          cup, partaking of the sweet, golden nectar. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          wind persists, with swirls of sand that sting the face and scratch the 
          eyes. But there is still so much to see, the world alive with the pulse 
          of spring and glow of morning. Who among you would turn back now? Not 
          I. I forge ahead, through an army of saguaro cacti, saluting at attention 
          as I parade by. The color show continues with sunflowers, scarlet penstemon, 
          paintbrush, and so much more. It seems to me the wonder of life is accented 
          in the desert by the very paucity of nature, each miracle standing alone 
          in the rock and sand, vivid and free, the way it should be.</font></p>
