        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">From the 
          dawn of civilization religious and philosophical thought has had a major 
          influence on the way man perceives the world. But a new force emerged 
          about two centuries ago-the ideas of economics-which has come to profoundly 
          influence, and some would say dominate, our worldview and social structure.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The first 
          scholar to analyze this new wave of thought was Englishman Adam Smith 
          in his <em>On the Wealth of Nations</em>, published in 1776. He proposed 
          that individuals, acting in their own self-interest as producers and 
          consumers, would lead to the best outcome for society at large. He shared 
          the common eighteenth century belief in the inevitability of progress 
          and saw society as engaged in a process of continual improvement through 
          accumulation of individual wealth (a break from earlier, more pessimistic, 
          Judeo-Christian thought). At the core of his philosophy was the concept 
          of a self-regulating market with prices set by competition and a balance 
          between supply and demand. Smith's ideas came to be known as classical 
          or &quot;free market&quot; economics, and have become deeply ingrained 
          in modern industrial societies. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The concept 
          of centrally planned economies represented a counter to Smith's free 
          market. In the twentieth century most nations turned to one of these 
          systems. There was common ground, primarily the worship of progress 
          through economic growth, but a radical difference in how this would 
          be achieved. The major difference was in how economic decisions would 
          be made. In a pure socialist economy the government owns and controls 
          the means of production, distribution, and exchange. Marx and Lenin, 
          the system's founder and principal proponent, believed that it would 
          be more efficient at meeting the real needs of people through decisions 
          made by their wise leaders. It is a system of fairness-&quot;from each 
          according to his abilities and to each according to his needs&quot;-at 
          least in theory. During the 20th century some viewed Marxism as the 
          world's greatest hope, while others thought it the greatest threat.</font></p>

        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For nearly 
          all of the last century the Soviet Union was the world's most powerful 
          communist country and centrally planned economy. It was a union of 15 
          republics, including Ukraine (photograph), and one of two superpowers 
          that stood eyeball-to-eyeball during the Cold War. The dramatic collapse 
          of the Soviet Union in 1991 is well known. Sadly this has led to economic 
          chaos in most of the nations that were once part of that union. There 
          are only five remaining communist countries in the world (China, Laos, 
          Vietnam, Cuba, North Korea) and most are slowly converting to free market 
          economies. Vietnam, in fact, has one of the fastest growing economies 
          in the world since encouraging private ownership of industry, commerce, 
          and agriculture. (next photo)</font></p>
