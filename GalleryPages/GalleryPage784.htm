          We are at the mercy of so few<br>
          With evil hearts determined to<br>
          Reduce this planet to hell<br>

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">On 
          the other hand, political extremists, slightly to the right of Atilla 
          the Hun, could make any reasonable person blow a gasket. They are a 
          wealthy minority, pro-development at any cost, and well funded by the 
          extractive industries. They equate environmentalism with socialism and 
          other evils, and have little regard for the only known living planet 
          in the universe. They are mean spirited and self-righteous, with a myopic 
          worldview. And today their whining is louder than ever, because they 
          are worried. And for good reason. The opposition to their ways is formidable 
          and growing. Consider some of the issues from bygone days. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          1974 the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power recommended a 400 
          foot high dam that would flood 54 miles of the Grand Canyon. For real! 
          Even extremists know better than to make such a proposal today. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          1975 the Pacer H-Bomb proposal would have detonated 2 hydrogen bombs 
          <em>daily</em> (730 per year) in a salt cavern to generate power for 
          Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi (I'm not making this stuff up-google 
          it). This is typical of the radical right's megalomanic approach to 
          problem solving. The idea was considered absurd back then. Today such 
          a proposal would get you a paid vacation in a padded room. (Note-a single 
          hydrogen bomb has more explosive power than all the bombs dropped by 
          the allied forces in WW 2)</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          the late 1980's a movement to restore wolves to the Greater Yellowstone 
          Ecosystem was gaining momentum. Surveys showed 75% of Americans were 
          in favor of the project. Nevertheless, Montana Congressman Ron Marlenee 
          went on the offensive, describing wolves as &quot;the equivalent of 
          cockroaches.&quot; At the same time a misinformed but always unenlightened 
          Senator Alan Simpson, of Wyoming, asserted that &quot;wolves chased 
          women in Russia.&quot; This rhetoric was part of a campaign to stall 
          the project. It failed. In 1995 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service director 
          Mollie Beattie personally released a caged Canadian wolf into our oldest 
          and most revered national park, restoring the missing ecological link 
          to the region. </font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          wolf restoration program has been a resounding success. There is now 
          a limited hunting season to control the number of wolves outside the 
          park and ranchers are compensated for the rare livestock kill. And to 
          this date (almost 20 years) there have been no reported attacks on humans. 
          Wolves in Yellowstone bring in an estimated $35 million dollars in annual 
          revenue to the region. Nearly half (45%) of Yellowstone visitors site 
          the wolf as the species they most want to see. Sometimes you have to 
          look back to see how far you've come.</font></p>
