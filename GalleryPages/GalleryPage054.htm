          The new millennium is five days old. I book passage on and board the 
          Yermelova, an ancient Russian icebreaker. Her rusted hull and dilapidated 
          decks do not instill confidence. I make note of the nearest lifeboat 
          and pay attention at safety drills. We are making the long, circuitous 
          voyage from Ushuaia, Argentina, the world's most southerly city, to 
          the Falkland Islands, then South Georgia, and finally the Antarctica 
          Peninsula. We will close the loop by sailing across the infamous Drake 
          Passage, stormiest of seas, past the forlorn outcrop of Cape Horn, the 
          southernmost tip of South America, then back to Ushuaia. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">By 
          any measure this is an adventure. Not Shackleton or Scott mind you, 
          but macho by Y2K standards. There are no balmy ports of call, feather 
          pillows, or medivac. No five star anything. The Yermelova is not a cruise 
          ship! She will roll with the punches, so everyone has a patch or pill, 
          something to tame the tempest in their gut. On the plus side, I've been 
          told the ship's cabins have heaters that sometimes work. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Rather 
          than a luxury cruise this is a floating seminar with a glorious outdoor 
          lab for nature enthusiasts. Lectures are scheduled, by naturalists, 
          geologists, photographers, and other assorted experts. We will spend 
          long days at sea, to read, watch for whales, and marvel at the flight 
          of the albatross, gliding effortlessly over the rolling sea. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          mostly there are the shore excursions, hours and hours each day to mingle 
          with, observe, and photograph the fabulous wildlife of the Southern 
          realm, twice as tame and nearly as inquisitive as we are. It should 
          make for high adventure that some say rivals East Africa for nature 
          red, tooth and claw. (next photo)</font></p>
