          The skies are crystal clear night and day and from one dawn to the next 
          a man learns why he left Tennessee, Virginia, or whatever state. To 
          be carried along by swift waters. To drift like a pilgrim through an 
          immense cathedral. To witness a gash in the earth beyond comprehension. 
          To read a colossal text of earth's history. To repeat Major Powell's

          Marie, our gorgeous and intrepid river guide, takes a plunge into the 
          cool pool at Elves Chasm of Grand Canyon. The eight day, 277 mile Colorado 
          River rafting trip through the canyon included many side trips to spice 
          up the adventure. This was one of them. Precious rain percolates through 
          the various limestone layers that constitute the canyon's aquifers, 
          then surfaces as springs or waterfalls. Perhaps the most famous falls 
          are at Havasu, a world-class photography and hiking destination, but 
          there are many others offering a refreshing break from the desert heat. 
          The water at Elves Chasm is a cool, clear 50 degrees.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There 
          were two pontoon boats on this &quot;5-star&quot; river cruise, each 
          with a head guide and an assistant. The head guides were female and 
          their assistants were male. Talk about a shift in social paradigms!<br>
