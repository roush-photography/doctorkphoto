      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        jungles of Borneo are not teeming with massive trees and charismatic megafauna, 
        much to the chagrin of many first time visitors. Present but seldom seen 
        are the world's largest flower, orchid, and moth. Sun bears, clouded leopards, 
        elephants, and rhinoceroses are super secretive, and thus a few still 
        hang on in scattered pockets of precious forests. They too are almost 
        never seen by the casual visitor. A research scientist recently reported 
        living with and studying orangutans for two years and never laying eyes 
        on one. Hard to believe 300 pounds of anything can escape being seen. 
        Fortunately the researcher was studying the nests they make each night 
        which can be seen the following morning, minus the occupants.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        jungle is a small world on a big scale. There are millions of known insects 
        to go with the bazillions we don't know. Included are ants, beetles, and 
        termites, to name a few. And then there are the spiders. And flying squirrels, 
        lizards, frogs, and snakes. And what is true for the big guys is also 
        true for the little guys. They tend to be nocturnal, camouflaged, and 
        mostly in the tree tops. Thus they are rarely seen, much to the relief 
        of most first time visitors. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Yet 
        despite the ghostly presence of so many species, the rain forest of Borneo 
        is a magical place, a fairy-tale that is real. To walk into its palpable 
        presence is to come alive with all the senses. This is the Garden of Eden, 
        the world as it was bequeathed, the most complex and beautiful corner 
        of the universe. Whether it's a spider's web bejeweled with morning dew, 
        the flick of a lizard's tongue, a snake swallowing a snake, or an orangutan 
        crashing through the trees, there is always something to enchant. If you 
        take the time to notice. (next photo)<br>
