        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The next 
          morning we depart early and the crew assures me things will get better. 
          Things quickly get worse. Around every turn of the poisonous river is 
          a new and frightening reality. As my eyes open wider I notice that more 
          than wildlife is missing from this erstwhile paradise. The <em>forest</em> 
          is gone from the jungle! How crazy is that? I am cruising a corridor 
          of pseudojungle, a riverine gauntlet of trees, perhaps 25 meters wide, 
          and spangled with the occasional bird or monkey. The trees have been 
          left along the river bank to appease the tourist. I am not appeased. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And 
          even this bit of &quot;consolation&quot; forest is fleeting. Within 
          an hour of departure we enter a gray shroud of smoke and have to pull 
          over to the bank. We cannot see! Progress is impossible for the time 
          being so we wait. Everyone coughs. I decide to hike through the trees, 
          which won't take long, and see what's on the other side. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">On 
          the other side of the trees I witness an apocalypse, a scene from Edgar 
          Allen Poe, minus the raven (it died from mercury). Modern Borneo has 
          been compared to post-war Vietnam and I see why. The rolling landscape 
          is scorched to the horizon, baked black and dusted with crispy white 
          ash. A black and white hell. Tendrils of smoke curl upward from the 
          cracked earth and merge with the toxic blanket of &quot;fog.&quot; Skeletal 
          tree trunks are the only reminders that yesterday this was the crucible 
          of evolution, the most biodiverse spot on earth. In the far distance 
          I can hear gears grind and a pneumatic wheeze-logging trucks carrying 
          ancient trees on the first leg of their journey to Japan.</font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          1997 an estimated 10,000 square miles of Borneo, an area about the size 
          of Vermont, went up in smoke for the sake of palm oil and &quot;progress.&quot; 
          The result was one of history's great ecological disasters. The smoky 
          aftermath spread like a pall over eight countries and 75 million people, 
          enshrouding an area larger than Europe and straining local tempers. 
          Twenty million were treated for pollution related ailments. An airplane 
          crashed in the smog over Sumatra killing hundreds. Ships collided at 
          sea or ran aground. Economies lost billions from cancelled tourism, 
          missed work days, medical bills, and ruined crops. But what does it 
          matter? There is palm oil for everyone. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And 
          so it goes in Borneo. </font></p>
