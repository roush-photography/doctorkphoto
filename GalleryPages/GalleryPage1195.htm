          His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama</font></em></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Earth 
          has been called the Living Planet, and for good reason. An amazing menagerie 
          of life resides on this tiny blue orb as she floats through the black 
          of space. The number of species has been estimated between 30 and 100 
          million, only 1.7 million of which have been identified. And every life-form 
          on earth respires with a single purpose: that the generations roll on. 
          The power for this is infinite, the design elegant, whether you're talking 
          pollination by the birds and bees or human sexuality. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          spite of this incredible diversity of form and function, the fundamental 
          similarity of all life is equally remarkable. Living things share a 
          basic cellular, biomolecular, and genetic structure, indicating common 
          roots. We are astonished to learn that we share 99 percent of our DNA 
          with chimps (or is it the other way around?), but what about 40 percent 
          with an earthworm? On a quantum level life consists of protons, neutrons, 
          electrons, bosons, and quarks, surrounded by mostly empty space. To 
          a chemist, a carbon atom is a carbon atom, whether it comes from a human 
          or a slug. What a grand mystery!</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
          shared design suggests to many a purpose and spirituality to life on 
          earth. Call it God, the Tao, or whatever, it provides order and harmony 
          to our often frenzied lives. And it promotes a sense of connectivity 
          to other people and to nature. This profound understanding then influences 
          conduct. Morality becomes an imperative. The basic kinship binding all 
          life together demands that we minimize harm to other species, as the 
          Buddhists have been saying for 2,500 years. </font></p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">One 
          of the great mysteries of life is instinct. Since there are no technology 
          schools for albatross on the Falkland Islands, how did this one know 
          when, where, and how to construct the pottery-style nest shown in the 
          photograph?</font></p>
