        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          Grand Canyon of the Colorado River is something very special, an &quot;awesome 
          statement, even for nature to make,&quot; as John Muir said. The entire 
          region is wierd and wonderful. Nowhere else is there this sweet combination 
          of uplifted sedimentary rock in a desert environment, exposed to carving 
          by a raging river for millions of years. The result is an alien landscape 
          of form and color played upon by light.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Vault 
          of the heavens! A picture framed by sky! A mountain turned upside down! 
          And all the other inadequate descriptions that fill tomes. Despite the 
          best efforts of poets, painters, philosophers, photographers, presidents, 
          and normal folks, the Grand Canyon defies representation. It must be 
          experienced with heart and senses, and even then the canyon remains 
          aloof from mere mortals, sharing her deep secrets only with the angels. 
          And so we return (15 times for me), ever in search of the canyon soul, 
          beyond worldly grasp.</font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
          bit of trick photography? Perhaps. This picture was taken in the gorgeous 
          slot of Antelope Canyon (see previous picture), where every day a shaft 
          of light beams down as the sun arches over at midday. With normal exposure 
          the subject is awash in unflattering harsh light. However, with one 
          simple tweak of a camera setting, called spot metering, the angel is 
          rendered in perfect light as the canyon walls go dark. Such is the phenomenon 
          of dynamic range. </font></p>
