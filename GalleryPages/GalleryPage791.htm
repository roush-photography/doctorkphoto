        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Nothing 
          prepares you for the giant redwood forest. No matter how many times 
          you read about it or see it in pictures, it will still take your breath 
          away. Your mind will shut down, unable to comprehend anything of this 
          stature, and for several minutes you will stand there, lost for words 
          and awestruck. You will wonder how anything on earth could be so magnificent. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It 
          has been my good fortune to have gazed upon many of the world's great 
          panoramas-Grand Canyon, Machu Picchu, Iguazu Falls-and each is dazzling 
          in its own right. But for sheer impact, the view and cathedral-like 
          silence of a grove of giant redwoods compares with any. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Coastal 
          redwoods of northern California grow within a few miles of the world's 
          largest ocean and spend much of their lives shrouded in fog as a result. 
          For the photographer this is mostly a good thing. It not only adds a 
          sense of mystery to the forest, but it softens the light and reduces 
          glare in the godbeams of this underworld. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          this is ridiculous! The fog is everywhere, threaded among the trees, 
          adrift on meadows, and rising like steam from the asphalt. It reminds 
          me of pea soup, so thick I can part it or play with it, which I am in 
          no mood to do. I feel damp and dispirited but take solace in knowing 
          that all fog must lift sometime, even this one. But when?</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          path is slippery from condensation, but the air feels clean and refreshing. 
          I shuffle cautiously forward, ever deeper into the gloomy silence. All 
          I hear are my own muffled footsteps and the sound of dewdrops falling 
          like light rain. Visibility in this white world is measured in inches. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And 
          then a miracle in the woods. The fog parts ever so slightly from above, 
          admitting a golden beam through the trees, to the forest floor. And 
          then it is like a theatre curtain being drawn apart. I force myself 
          not to shout as I comprehend the surroundings. My eyes are pulled upward, 
          along the beam, and I can see I am enveloped by the world's tallest 
          trees as they reach to the giddying heights of heaven. A collective 
          sigh of &quot;Jeesus!&quot; echoes from up and down the trail. I just 
          thought I was alone. </font></p>
