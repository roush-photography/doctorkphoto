          <font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Africa 
          has been called the most romantic and tragic of continents. She is the 
          Garden of Eden, the cradle of mankind, and the ancient stage upon which 
          our earliest dramas unfolded. Despite 200 years of European pilfering 
          she is still home to the greatest wildlife show on earth and remains 
          a sanctuary for people struggling to maintain traditional ways and hide 
          from the West. <br>
          <br>
          On the other hand most African nations are racked with poverty, AIDS, 
          malaria, illiteracy, corruption, and civil unrest. The majority of Africans 
          endure the worst standard of living in the world with little prospect 
          for improvement in the face of famine, disease, and malignant population 
          growth. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
          A revolution in human understanding is the only thing that can save 
          Eden now. With the proliferation and spread of humanity the Garden is 
          on a collision course with doom. Forests are being &#8220;desertified&#8221; 
          and wildlife is going extinct, or being sentenced to a life behind bars. 
          Meanwhile more and more people are living a marginal existence in places 
          that animals and plants once thrived.<br>
          <br>
          We can take solace in our world of human comforts, but we cannot recover 
          that which is lost. We will bear a burden of guilt for our deeds and 
          heartbreak for our failure. The loss of Africa&#8217;s great herds and 
          jungly profusion will signal a complete divorce of humanity from its 
          own long history and a dismal disregard for the future.<br>
