        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I was 
          raised a few miles up the road from the Gulf of Mexico and spent a lot 
          of time there, vacationing with my family. I fished, crabbed, swam, 
          and explored miles of deserted beaches. The Gulf seemed infinite back 
          then, chock full of speckled trout, red snapper, blue crab, and mysterious 
          creatures of the deep that washed ashore and never ceased to amaze. 
          In those days the beaches were buttery colored dunes anchored by sea 
          oats and patrolled only by gulls and pelicans. The salty surf teemed 
          with a cornucopia of shells, of every size, shape, and color.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Then in 
          decades, not eons, it all changed. The bounty began to disappear before 
          our very eyes. Before we knew it the monk seal was gone, the manatee 
          endangered. By the end of the 20th century the Gulf had been nearly 
          depleted of apex species, a result of overfishing. Populations of shark, 
          swordfish, marlin, tuna, turtle, and whale were down 50 to 90 percent. 
          Half of all coral reefs were seriously damaged or dead! Miles and miles 
          of marsh and sea grass meadow were converted to malls, marinas, and 
          motels. Oil rigs by the thousands were strewn about the coast and continental 
          shelf. And instead of nurturing the Gulf of Mexico with nutrients the 
          Mississippi River poisoned it with toxic chemicals. Poets penned odes 
          to the &quot;Sea of Sacrifice,&quot; lamenting the price paid for the 
          modern world.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Gulf 
          is in deep trouble. But alas, a few bright spots still flicker out there. 
          Some areas have managed to escape the trawler. In spite of the massive 
          environmental degradation, there is still an asonishing diversity of 
          life waiting on tighter fishing controls to repopulate. And there are 
          even a few much needed sanctuaries, around Florida, Mexico, and Cuba, 
          and more being discussed. These provide hope for the Gulf, and for us 
          all.</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia"> Japan is one of the nations most responsible 
          for the worldwide collapse of commercial fish species, through harmful 
          and unsustainable fishing practices. And marine mammals aren't spared 
          either. The Japanese continue whaling despite a worldwide moratorium 
          declared in the 1980s by the International Whaling Commission. Whale 
          meat is consumed only because it is a status symbol, an exotic delicacy 
          in elite social circles. </font></p>
