        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Demographers 
          generally agree that the <em>demographic transition, </em>when populations 
          stabilize, will have spread around the world by mid-century. This is 
          a good thing. On the other hand, best case scenario, the earth will 
          then be inhabited by nine billion people. Those less optimistic say 
          15 billion! This is not good. Just how bad it will be is on a lot of 
          people's minds. Given man's remarkable ability to adapt, it's also very 
          hard to say.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Will 
          the world be a hellish place then? There is real reason for concern. 
          Some parts are already hellish. There are 21 megacities in the world 
          that have populations of more than 10 million, with poor nations expected 
          to add many more by mid-century. Delhi's numbers swell each year with 
          migrants from the countryside who arrive to find things as bad, or worse, 
          than back home-overcrowded, filthy, and not enough to eat and drink. 
          A better life can be hard to come by. The same story can be told around 
          the globe-Dhaka in Bangladesh, Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of 
          the Congo, and others. Some of these cities have seen populations increase 
          by a factor of 40 since 1950! </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Nations 
          can face the same pressures as cities. Bangladesh, one of the most densely 
          populated countries in the world, is also one slated to suffer most 
          from the ill effects of climate change. Rising sea levels will displace 
          tens of millions. Where will they go? And things in Rwanda may be worse. 
          It can be argued that the genocidal massacre of a million or more Rwandans 
          in 1994 was caused by more than just Hutu hatred. Overpopulation was 
          the root cause. There were simply too many farmers dividing their land 
          into increasingly small fractions that no longer fed families. Hunger 
          and crowding make us do desperate things. </font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As 
          long as people are fed human populations are remarkably resilient. In 
          the above photo cyclos and people crowd the streets of Saigon, in Vietnam, 
          one of the most overpopulated countries in the world <em>despite nearly 
          constant warfare in the last half of the 20th century</em>. The same 
          rapid population recovery also happened in Rwanda after the genocide. 
          One has to wonder how much longer our ingenuity can save us. </font></p>
