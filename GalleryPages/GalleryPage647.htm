        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Isolation 
          and seasonal flooding may not be enough to preserve the unique ranching 
          culture of the Pantanal. There are threats from without and within. 
          The grand old ranches are few and far between today, most of them having 
          been divided among heirs for so many generations that the parcels are 
          now too small to support herds that pay. That is unless you clear the 
          high forests which would be a death knell to wildlife, so much a part 
          of the essential Pantanal character. And clearing forests will lead 
          to erosion and loss of high ground with the possibility of total seasonal 
          flooding, as in the Amazon. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">An 
          even bigger threat lies to the northeast. Here agribusiness-soybean 
          and cotton plantations-is proliferating rapidly. Eroded sediments, carrying 
          a cargo of damaging fertilizer and herbicides, are washing across the 
          floodplain, threatening much of the Pantanal. And these powerful business 
          groups are lobbying the government to dredge the Paraguay River for 
          supertankers and then build superhighways across the region to whisk 
          their goods to market. Such massive projects would be disastrous for 
          the Pantanal's fragile hydraulics, and, therefore, its unique way of 
          life. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          the seventies, to ease population pressure along the coast, the Brazilian 
          government began encouraging westward migration with offers of free 
          land. All you had to do was show up, stake a claim, and start farming 
          or ranching. Many of them did so in the area around the Pantanal. The 
          Pantanal's ranchers, contending with seasonal flooding, could not compete 
          with the new arrivals, able to ranch full time. More cattle came to 
          market and prices tumbled. It was no contest. The fiercely proud ranchers 
          of the Pantanal reluctantly turned to ecotourism to supplement their 
          dwindling incomes. (next photo)<br>
