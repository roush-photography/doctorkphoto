          Happy birthday and bully to a second century! Thanks to all the dedicated 
          park rangers who continue to foster this grand concept. Overworked and 
          underpaid, they serve the cause as a calling, nearly a religion. Their's

          therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner 
          and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of 
          future generations.&quot; With a scribble of his scholarly pen President 
          Woodrow Wilson thus established the National Park Service in 1916 and 
          set into motion a visionary concept that America has exported around 
          the world. Thirty-six national parks were gathered under the umbrella 
          of this single agency in what British ambassador to the U.S. James Bryce 
          called &quot;America's greatest gift to the world.&quot; Other nations 
          had preserved gardens and green spaces, but only for kings, queens, 
          and aristocrats. In America parks were for all the people. Most nations 
          today, rich or poor, have some semblance of a national park system.</font></p>
