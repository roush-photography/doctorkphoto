        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Climbing 
          Mt. Shuksan is interesting on many levels. I should know. I stood atop 
          her serrated summit (far distance) recently, climbing through the clouds 
          on my way to the stars. In doing so I had to deal with <em>empty air, 
          </em>thousands of feet of what climbers nonchalantly refer to as &quot;exposure,&quot; 
          a downplay on words to say the least. Many times I found myself clinging 
          to rock or ice with white knuckled fingers and toes, whispering the 
          mantra &quot;Don't look down!&quot; Occasionally I cheated and looked 
          anyway, which resulted in tighter grasping and much gasping.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          don't want to overstate my climbing abilities. I was well guided on 
          this ascent. I always go with someone who can catch me (on this occasion 
          <em>her</em> name was Georgie)! And, per usual, as I stumbled my way 
          to the summit in unheroic fashion, in Georgie's shadow, I felt pretty 
          damn good about it. And even better when we made it back down in one 
          piece.</font></p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          climbed Mt. Shuksan in 1998. It was a training climb for Aconcagua, 
          in Argentina, the tallest peak in the Western Hemisphere. I trained 
          for two years to achieve the goal of bringing in the new millennium 
          atop that great summit.</font></p>
