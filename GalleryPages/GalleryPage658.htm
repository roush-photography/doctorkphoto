          Ernest Hemingway</font></em></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Until 
          the mid 1900's Borneo was one of the great jungles on earth, a heart 
          of darkness, dripping, teeming, ripe, and risky. The kind of place that 
          made Joseph Conrad's pen restless. This emerald island, third largest 
          in the world after Greenland and New Guinea, was largely unexplored 
          until then, a land of legend that aroused fear in great white hunters. 
          Here lurked lost tribes of head-hunters and man-eating apes called <em>ut-ut</em>.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          that was then. The Borneo of today has aged 200 years in the last 25. 
          She is on the brink of the modern world, with bustling towns, scheduled 
          flights, and even sporadic electricity. Conspicuously absent are neon 
          lights, glitzy cities, and most trappings of 21st century pop culture. 
          Coca-cola is here but fast food is not. Prepare to eat rice three time 
          a day if you go. Boiled chicken twice. Not bad for the first week. Only 
          the larger towns have paved roads. Most highways are rivers carrying 
          people and commerce to and fro. The homes are wooden shacks, stilted 
          and thatched. Native Dayak of the interior still live in longhouses.

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It 
          is dawn in the rain forest of Borneo. Mist hangs in the air, between 
          branches and lianas, and rises high into the sky as clouds. Frogs and 
          birds beckon, unseen in the morning light. Gibbons begin their staccato 
          hoots from across the valley. Suddenly, in a nearby tree there is a 
          loud snap. I freeze, trying hard to see everything at once without moving 
          or breathing. Then I hear a <em>kiss-squeak </em>and know I am in the 
          company of a legend. The &quot;man of the forest.&quot; Only this man 
          is a female with tiny hands and feet clinging to her side. With an amoeboid 
          body twist the youngster's face appears, rimmed by a halo of electric 
          hair. I am spellbound. (next photo)</font></p>
