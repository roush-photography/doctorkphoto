        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For more 
          than a century photography has opened our eyes wider to the beauty and 
          wonder of the world. It has permitted us to see things we could not 
          before the frozen image, e.g. a horse suspended in midair at full gallop. 
          It has expanded the concept of aesthetics, the sheer number of beautiful 
          objects that are out there. Items once considered mundane, not worth 
          the artist's effort, have been elevated to art with a camera: a dew 
          drop; an autumn leaf; a single blossom illuminated by a godbeam. And 
          we can capture different viewpoints, from the microscope to the telescope, 
          and even the satellite, and archive them for posterity. What a thrill 
          it must have been for the old photographers to contemplate going beyond 
          the paintbrush, to actually freezing the real thing, creating a permanent 
          record of people and their world. It must have seemed a miracle back 
          then. How far we've come and it still does.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Given 
          its widespread application it is hard to underestimate the influence 
          of photography on modern life, from selling widgets to stopping wars. 
          Few would argue that the camera is more powerful than the paintbrush 
          or musical note, especially when one considers that television and movies 
          are merely moving <em>pictures</em>.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Just 
          as importantly, photography has become a valued part of most lives, 
          not just the artistic few. Surveys show that 90% of homes in the U.S. 
          take photos. Thus each of us can preserve memories to revisit privately, 
          to share with family and friends, or to post on a website and make a 
          statement. And how do you put a price on laughter, love, or personal 
          satisfaction?</font></p>
