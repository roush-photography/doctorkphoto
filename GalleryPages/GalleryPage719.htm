          from a windy stretch of desert south of Tucson, the whitewashed exterior 
          of Mission San Xavier del Bac presents a striking contrast to her environs. 
          Visitors as well as the faithful flock to this consecrated suburban 
          oasis. Located on the massive Tohono O'odham (formerly the Papago) reservation, 
          this Spanish colonial mission still serves the native peoples she was 
          designed for. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          recognition of 200 years of service this beacon of the desert was given 
          a much needed facelift in the nineties. Conservators from the U.S. and 
          Europe joined with native apprentices for the five year reconstruction. 
          Erased from the saints and seraphim of the hallowed sanctuary were water 
          stains, dust, wasp nests, bird poop, and candle soot, restoring their 
          celestial radiance. </font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          arrived at the mission before dawn to photograph the morning as she 
          shone on the unearthly white walls. The desert sunrise did not disappoint. 
          As the light show progressed I noticed a stream of cars arriving at 
          the adjoining mission school, dropping off children for the day. Framed 
          by the stunning portico of the school their quickstep to class provided 
          an unforgettable highlight to an already perfect morning. </font></p>
