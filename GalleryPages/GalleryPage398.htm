        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And 
          this is my quest, a fluffy white ball with two black eyes. Each year 
          250,000 harp seals migrate from Greenland to bear their young on the 
          ice floes that surround the Magdalen Islands. For decades the pups were 
          hunted, clubbed in the head for their immaculate white fur to make coats 
          for the European well-to-do. Blood and brains were spilled in full view 
          of terrified mother seals. Often the pups were only stunned, and cried 
          out as they were skinned alive, their cries ignored by the pitiless 
          sealers.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          the 1980's a long sought miracle happened. Groups of protesters gathered 
          on the ice during the March hunt. They brought with them cameras and 
          cans of green spray paint. At great risk of harm (some were), they filmed 
          the horrific slaughter and sprayed as many pups as they could with the 
          paint, rendering their fur worthless. Many pups were killed anyway. 
          Photos and videos of the hunt were circulated worldwide. An angry public 
          raised an outcry and Europe, the principle market, issued a ban on the 
          import of harp seal fur. After a long and bitter struggle a cruel industry 
          was dead.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
          decade later ecotourism groups began visiting the Maggies, toting only 
          cameras. I am now one of them. Our guides are the former seal hunters, 
          employed again by taking us out on the ice they know so well. Win-Win!</font></p>
