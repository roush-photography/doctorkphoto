          have to accept the fact that we are trashing the world and start asking 
          &quot;When are we going to stop?&quot;<br>
          David Brower</font></em></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">My 
          purpose as a photographer is to point out our connection with the natural 
          world to an increasingly alienated audience. The generation now poised 
          to inherit the earth is the first to be so detached from her. For millions 
          of years we lived as other species, eking out a daily survival from 
          the world around us, and mindful on some level of how utterly dependent 
          we were on a healthy and abundant world. Virtually all early cultures 
          worshipped nature. <br>
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          Alas, nothing has changed about this but our perception, distorted as 
          it is by our encapsulation within the cocoons of a contrived and manufactured 
          modern world-home, workplace, and city. Add to this the illusory world 
          of television and computers and you have a generation for which nature 
          is an abstraction, suffering from what author Richard Louv calls &quot;nature 
          deficit syndrome.&quot; The real world has been replaced by a small 
          screen that we are tethered to for hours every day, frantically trying 
          to fill our pocketbooks and our emptyness. Of course, we can't, so we 
          turn to other things even less healthy for us, like drink and drug, 
          in a futile effort to soothe our souls. As Thoreau stated, &quot;If 
          misery loves company misery has company enough.&quot; </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Ninety-nine 
          percent of all species that have ever lived are extinct, and so are 
          the days numbered for us. If we persist with the arrogant notion that 
          we are separate from nature then that number will indeed be small. We 
          must recognize that we are a part of nature, but also a force against 
          the whole of nature-like the wind, the tides, and even the earthquake-and 
          begin to moderate our ways, to live in harmony with the world around 
          us. <br>

          The fairy tern above was likely encountering a human for the first time. 
          The scene was Dulce Island, a tiny atoll in the Gambiers, lost somewhere 
          in the vastness of the South Pacific. Dulce is uninhabited and hundreds 
          of miles from any island that is. It is just as far from any international 
          shipping lane. In our 30 days of sailing from Easter Island to Bora 
          Bora we did not see another vessel. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And 
          yet as we made landfall on Dulce, ostensibly to visit the nesting bird 
          colonies, what impressed us most was the trash, the flotsam and jetsam 
          that had been beached by tide and storm. This entire island, a world 
          away from human <font face="Georgia">endeavor</font>, was strewn with 
          the universal &quot;spoor&quot; of civilization. It was a shocking revelation 
          to a shipload of people who had traveled so far to get away from such.</font></p>
