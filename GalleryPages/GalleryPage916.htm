        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Minamata 
          is a remote coastal village located on Japan's westernmost island of 
          Kyushu. For most of its history the town's economy depended on the sea 
          and the sea was stingy. The people of Minamata struggled to make ends 
          meet. And then Chisso Corporation arrived in the early 1900s and things 
          began to look up. After WW 2 Chisso began producing acetaldehyde, used 
          in the manufacture of plastics, and the local economy boomed. The people 
          of Minamata were beholden to the company. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
          It began in the late 1940s with street cats twitching uncontrollably. 
          The villagers called it &quot;dancing&quot; in the streets and laughed. 
          Then the cats began to drop dead. Still not to worry. There was little 
          regard for the stray cats in Mimamata. Only the most cynical of the 
          locals gave this much thought. They began to wonder if these were not 
          cats at all, but canaries in disguise. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And then, 
          in 1950, a few of the fishermen and their families began to exhibit 
          strange behavior. They would stumble and fall, tremble violently, and 
          shout uncontrollably. Later they suffered seizures, hearing loss, and 
          partial paralysis. These people were ignored too, even snubbed by much 
          of the community. After all they were fishermen who were poor and therefore, 
          like cats, didn't matter much. Then, in 1956, an epidemic of the symptoms 
          broke out, even in a few of the more affluent factory workers. Then 
          there was much confusion and fear in Minamata. And even more so when 
          children began to be born with severe birth defects, including mental 
          retardation and crippling limb deformities. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1959 
          medical researchers identified the cause of the syndrome as heavy metal 
          poisoning with mercury from eating fish and shellfish out of Minamata 
          Bay. The mercury was a by-product of the manufacture of acetaldehyde 
          by Chisso. To dispose of the stuff the company poured it into the local 
          bay whereupon it was supposedly diluted to insignificance. The &quot;Big 
          Earth&quot; concept.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The total 
          physical damage to humans will never be known, but experts estimate 
          10,000 were afflicted and 3,000 died. Over $600 million has been paid 
          out in compensation to victims. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But that's 
          not the end of this story. There were deep social undercurrents. Chisso 
          employed 60% of the villagers, having essentially inherited the role 
          of patriarchal lord from feudal Japan. The rest of the villagers were 
          fishermen who ate more fish and thus suffered most from the mercury. 
          The locals who depended on Chisso for their livelihood honored the company 
          with their loyalty. When fishermen demonstrated against Chisso for damages, 
          company workers organized counter-demonstrations. Even today Chisso, 
          which no longer makes acetaldehyde, has a positive image among many 
          in the community. But not everyone. In spite of all the money paid for 
          damages there are lingering resentments in Minamata.</font></p>
