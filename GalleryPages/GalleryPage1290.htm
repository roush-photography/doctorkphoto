        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There 
          are some who believe that species diversity should be preserved, not 
          just because it is valuable to us, but simply &quot;because.&quot; Such 
          people believe that each species is a creation of god and a product 
          of millions of years of evolution, and should be respected if for no 
          other reason. They argue that we are of the Earth and must take care 
          of our home (after all, if we can't live here, where will we go?). And 
          too, they say that it is selfish to exploit the entire planet without 
          regard for the future. Instead, we should be &quot;good stewards of 
          the Earth&quot; and consume modestly, for the sake of the next generation.

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          typical person with an eco consciousness is an urban dweller of the 
          first world, educated, and at least middle class. Basic needs are easily 
          met so there is much time for recreational thinking. They are very much 
          in a minority worldwide but have considerable voice and political clout 
          (money talks). Many others genuinely lament humanity's pillaging of 
          the planet but simply don't have the time to give it more than a passing 
          thought as they get through their days, preoccupied with more pressing 
          issues. Critically, the vast majority of persons on the planet do not 
          have the luxury of even caring. For most of them just getting enough 
          to eat is a daily struggle.</font></p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          blue and yellow macaw is truly one of nature's most beautiful creatures. 
          Though this magnificant bird is increasingly endangered from habitat 
          loss and the pet trade, efforts are being made to restore wild populations. 
          Research is supported by tourist dollars at such places as the Tambopata 
          Research Center, in Peru. Ecotourism encourages the conservation of 
          species around the world. Tourism without minimal impact, is not ecotourism.
