        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          Easter Islander's solution to the problem of statue transport provides 
          the key to the fate of their society. They had only human power to drag 
          the statues along, using tree trunks as rollers. Over time the population 
          increased to about 7000, bringing with it intense competition among 
          the clans to carve the most and biggest statues. Ultimately there were 
          hundreds of ceremonial platforms and over 800 statues on their tiny 
          singularity. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Then, 
          when the society was at its peak, something mysterious happened. Hundreds 
          of statues were abandoned, along transport roads and in various stages 
          of completion at the quarry. A civilization came to a halt. How? Why? 
          Civil war? Genocide? Theories abound. But the main force behind the 
          falling star of Polynesia was environmental degradation brought on by 
          massive deforestation of the entire island. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Gone 
          with the trees were fishing boats and nets, fuel, construction material, 
          and healthy soil to grow sweet potatoes. But just as important, without 
          trees for transport there was no reason to carve statues. Thus the people 
          had no work, as there was little else to do on Easter Island! The statues 
          were also the backbone of their religious rituals and ceremonial customs. 
          So too their spirit world collapsed. Thus in the end there was no food, 
          no fuel, no work, no religion, and no escape. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          story of Easter Island presents, in stark relief, what happens when 
          we lay waste the world around us. Their social order fell with the final 
          tree, and the islanders became mired in the drawn-out paroxysms of societal 
          and environmental collapse. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And 
          then along came the Europeans.</font></p>
