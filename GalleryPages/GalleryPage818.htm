          finality of extinction is awesome.<br>

          </font> </p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          value to humankind of ecosystems and the species that comprise them 
          is immeasurable. However, in purely economic terms it has recently been 
          estimated at 47 trillion dollars. To put this figure in perspective 
          the total world GDP is just slightly more. Simply put we are talking 
          here about the aggregate value of life on earth, surely beyond economics. 
          But unfortunately, the dollar is what policymakers understand. Given 
          the essential nature and enormous value of ecosystems, then we, as stewards 
          of the earth, must ensure their health and survival. Only in this manner 
          can we too survive. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Our 
          understanding of ecology and the need for conservation is very new, 
          little more than a single century of man's long history. Prior to this 
          time nature was wealth to be exploited or an adversary to be conquered. 
          Thus in the 1800s &quot;hunters&quot; on horseback in the American West 
          would kill bison by the millions, for hides, for meat, and for fun, 
          until they were nearly gone. And plume hunters decimated egrets of the 
          southern coastal states to make fashionable hats for the well-to-do 
          in New York and Chicago, until they too were nearly gone. The passenger 
          pigeon didn't fare so well. They were shot by the billions, for sport 
          and market, until they were totally gone. As in extinct. Not a single 
          pigeon anywhere. The year was 1914. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Appalled 
          at this wanton destruction, naturalists began calling for an end to 
          the slaughter. Their call was joined by a fledgling new organization 
          that would come to be known as <em>The National Audubon Society</em>. 
          A new morality was stirring.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          the new conservationists ran into a problem. They had to convince a 
          skeptical public that species were worth more alive than dead. This 
          would be easier said than done. Even today it is difficult to put a 
          dollar value on an animal or a plant, or on ecosystem services, unless 
          you actually sell them. How much is the deer you saw in the vacant lot 
          this morning really worth? Environmentalists have spent the last 100 
          years trying to answer these questions and make believers out of a disbelieving 
          public. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          argument over species preservation today runs the gamut from no rights 
          for animals to total rights, same as us. Most people agree that species 
          with unequivocal value to mankind, like trees and fish, should be managed 
          and protected. Support is mounting, however, for preserving species 
          for their own sake, even ones that may never be seen by a person other 
          than a scientist. This is an ethical debate, but supported by the notion 
          that any species may harbor a cure for arthritis or a solution to world 
          hunger. And there's always the attitude that we should save a species 
          just because it was placed placed on earth by god. </font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">Eighty percent of the 
          world's people live in crowded cities and slums as pictured above. Standard 
          of living, nutrition, and health care are well below the developed countries 
          of North America and western Europe. The conservation ethic is a hard 
          sell when people are crowded and hungry.</font></p>
