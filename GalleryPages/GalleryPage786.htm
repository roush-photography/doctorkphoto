        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Throughout 
          the 1920's numbers of migrating ducks and geese fell steadily. This 
          in spite of the Migratory Bird Act and the establishment of federal 
          waterfowl refuges, beginning with the Upper Mississippi Wildlife Refuge 
          in 1924. A newfangled concept of <em>habitat loss</em> was proposed 
          as the culprit in this continued decline. Massive tracts of wetlands, 
          where waterfowl breed, were being drained and converted into farmland 
          in the Great Plains. Was there a connection between this loss of wetlands 
          and declining waterfowl numbers?</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          Aldo Leopold believed there was. Inspired by the ecological wasteland 
          created by man on Grand Canyon's north rim, Leopold devoted himself 
          to the fledgling science of ecology. His methodical studies led to new 
          and landmark theories of game management. Leopold preached the importance 
          of habitat, behavior, food supply, breeding habits, and competition 
          to healthy wildlife populations, all radical notions at the time. In 
          other words species could not be managed without understanding how they 
          interact with their environment. The newfangled science now had a powerful 
          spokesman. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Still 
          most wildlife managers of the day were proponents of the &quot;innocent 
          wildlife&quot; and &quot;cruel predator&quot; concept. Federally funded 
          extermination campaigns against wolf, grizzly, coyote, and cougar were 
          effective, reducing, and in some cases eliminating, populations of these 
          predators from the American West, while prey populations exploded and 
          decimated the environment. Leopold's message, at least initially, was 
          falling on deaf ears. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There 
          were a few bright spots, however. In 1913 William Hornaday, director 
          of the Bronx Zoo, published <em>Our Vanishing Wildlife. </em>This impassioned 
          treatise played a role in saving the American bison and northern fur 
          seal from certain extinction. Hornady blamed unregulated shooting for 
          the rapid decline of game bird and mammal populations, a most unwelcome 
          idea to put it mildly. There was much defiance, the old guard giving 
          ground only grudgingly. But the young turks of conservation would prove 
          just as persistent. </font></p>
