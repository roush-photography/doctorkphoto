          things weren't all terrible as the Century of Conservation drew to a 
          close. It was a fabulous final act with Bill Clinton drawing the curtains. 
          One of history's great voices for the environment was Clinton's choice 
          for Vice President, Al Gore, whose book <em>Earth In the Balance</em> 
          was a best seller in the early 90s and received worldwide acclaim for 
          its exposure of critical environmental issues. After losing the closest 
          presidential election in history to a Supreme Court vote in 2000, the 
          wonkish Gore retired from politics. He moved back home to Tennessee 
          with very modest financial means, only to become one of the wealthiest 
          men in the country as a businessman in the private sector. He could 
          have kicked back and counted his change, but he didn't. He returned 
          to his passion, saving the environment, and the human race, by writing 
          his second book, <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em>, aimed at increasing 
          pubic awareness of the threat of global warming, possibly the best statement 
          on the crisis ever made. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          a bizarre twist garbage began to make the news, in a big way so to speak. 
          America was the self-proclaimed consumer society and these goods were 
          increasingly disposable. The result was a catchy new nickname for the 
          USA-the <em>throwaway society</em>. By century's end we were producing 
          municipal solid waste in amounts that truly boggled the mind. Disposal 
          costs soared-$5 for a single bag in some places, a dollar for a tire, 
          $30 for a refrigerator, and so forth. As a result people began dumping 
          tires, refrigerators, yard wastes, car parts, etc all over the countryside 
          to keep from having to pay. Places with dumpsters started padlocking 
          them to control illegal use. Some states established corps of environmental 
          police to track down midnight dumpers and prosecute.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          biggest environmental battle of the decade, the case of the northern 
          spotted owl, highlighted just how far we had come in the country since 
          six billion passenger pigeons were shot to extinction a century earlier. 
          The owl was listed as threatened by U.S. Fish and Wildlife. Not much 
          problem there. But when the decline was blamed on loss of old growth 
          forests in the Pacific Northwest things got interesting. The Endangered 
          Species Act of 1973 demanded that measures be taken to save the species, 
          which meant setting aside large tracts of these ancient forests as preserves. 
          Logging would have to be banned which, of course, put loggers out of 
          work. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          media had a field day with this one, pitting loggers and owls eyeball 
          to eyeball, in the news and on magazine covers (great photography I 
          might add). In the end the forests were preserved, owls got a new lease 
          on life, a new anticancer drug (taxol) was discovered in the bark of 
          the trees that were saved, and the loggers adjusted. The venomous rhetoric 
          died down much sooner than expected and life returned mostly to normal 
          in the Pacific Northwest. There were fewer logging trucks on the road 
          but more RVs, bringing happy tourists to see the forests that were saving 
          owls and helping win the war on breast and ovarian cancer. And if you 
          listened real carefully as you walked in these woods you could hear 
          the tourists exclaim, &quot;By god these trees are big!&quot; And the 
          trees were by God.</font></p>
