        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Time 
          to inspect the garden. I refer here to the garden that surrounds me 
          to distant hills, and beyond to the Santa Catalina Mountains. I hoist 
          a small pack containing bread and water, essentials for desert exploring, 
          and hit the trail. The wind blows sand in my teeth, but also brings 
          the scent of spring in the high desert, more than adequate compensation 
          for the grit.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Inventory. 
          Certainly the most stunning of desert flowers rightfully belongs to 
          that most desert of vegetables, the cacti: hedgehog, saguaro, fishhook, 
          and the others. Merely opinion, but there you have it. The sundry cactus 
          flowers have earned this high praise based on their large size, brilliant 
          colors, and their ephemeral nature, often appearing a single day per 
          year. This transience, again in my opinion, adds to their charm, in 
          the manner of a rare jewel. And the insects, at least, agree with me. 
          Seldom are these blooms without company, an intoxicated honeybee or 
          bumblebee wallowing inside the cup, partaking of the sweet golden nectar. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The wind 
          persists, with swirls of sand that sting my face and scratch my eyes. 
          But there is still so much to see, the world alive with the pulse of 
          spring and glow of morning. Who among you would turn back now? Not I. 
          I forge ahead, through an army of saguaro cacti, saluting at attention 
          as I parade by. The color show continues with sunflowers, scarlet penstemon, 
          paintbrush, and so much more. It seems to me the wonder of life is accented 
          in the desert by the very paucity of flora and fauna, each miracle standing 
          alone in the rock and sand, vivid and free, the way it should be. (next
