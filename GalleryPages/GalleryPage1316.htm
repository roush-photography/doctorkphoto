          been on earth, we were hunter and gatherers, <br>
          our lives dependent on knowing the small details of our world.<br>
          Janine Benyus</font></em></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hunters 
          and conservationists may seem at first like strange allies, but the 
          truth is many species might not survive if not for hunters shooting 
          at them. The nation's 12 million hunters are essential partners with 
          other conservation groups in wildlife management. Hunter organizations 
          (Ducks Unlimited, Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, etc) collect millions 
          of dollars per year from their members, of which 85 percent goes to 
          conservation. Ducks Unlimited alone has contributed $700 million since 
          its founding in 1934 which has helped add five million acres of wetlands 
          to the National Wildlife Refuge system. Also, hunting and fishing licenses 
          generate more than a billion dollars per year to help state agencies 
          acquire and improve wildlife habitat in every state. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">So 
          why does hunting seem increasingly irrelevant and misunderstood in today's 
          world? No mistake about it there is a dark side, and it makes headlines. 
          There is a small percent that ignores the rules meant to insure survival 
          of game species for all. They hunt out of season, trespass on private 
          property, ignore limits, spotlight deer, bait ducks, and shoot bears 
          illegally, then sell their gall bladders to Asian markets. They seem 
          disconnected from tradition and unconcerned about their impact on the 
          game they hunt. They are obsessed with guns and killing rather than 
          sport. And the recent upswing in gun related violence, debated endlessly 
          in the media, has had a negative effect on the nation's attitude toward 
          guns in general, including those used by the &quot;good guys.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Recent 
          decades have seen a decline in the number of hunters in this country 
          from 14 to 12 million, a mere 5% of the population. The niche formerly 
          occupied by hunters is being replaced by a new breed of outdoor enthusiast 
          concerned with the observation of nature, e.g. photography, bird-watching, 
          and so on. More than 30 percent of the U.S. adult population, or 75 
          million people, fits into this group. Whether wildlife watchers can 
          bankroll the outdoors and the infrastructure required to tend it like 
          hunters have in the past, remains to be seen. If visitation at national 
          parks is any indication then perhaps so. </font></p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hunters 
          played a critical role in the establishment of Bosque del Apache National 
          Wildlife Refuge which helped in the resurgence of the sandhill crane. 
          When the refuge opened in the 1930s 17 cranes were counted. This year 
          there were 20,000. The refuge is also noted for large numbers of snow 
          geese and other waterfowl.</font></p>
