        <p align="center"><em><font size="4">To love a swamp is to love what is 
          muted and marginal,<br>
          What exists in the shadow, what scurries along the damp edges.<br>
          Barbara Hurd</font></em></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It's early 
          A.M. and already warm and muggy. I am an hour out of New Orleans, cruising 
          I-10 across University Lake in Baton Rouge and watching the morning 
          parade go by. Soon I pass the nation's tallest state capitol building. 
          My pace remains steady, though, for I have no business in the city of 
          my birth. My destination is farther west, in Acadie (ah-cah-dee'), land 
          of the Cajuns. Family and friends have been notified and I have my passport, 
          just in case.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Past the 
          Mississippi River and many miles of sugar cane I begin crossing the 
          most expensive 30 miles of interstate ever constructed, a bridge over 
          Atchafalaya, largest fresh water swamp in the United States. The sun 
          sparkles o'er the tops of black willow and bald cypress. I gaze south 
          at a watery blackness that stretches 50 miles to the Gulf of Mexico 
          and ponder how eerily beautiful this yawning expanse really is. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Finally, 
          after nearly an hour over swamp, terra firma reappears. At the whistle-stop 
          of Cecilia I pull over for provisions at a small grocery. Inside the 
          dusty walls are adorned with swamp critters that have seen better days 
          and faded black and white photos of people devouring piles of crawfish, 
          the &quot;mud bug&quot; that is one of many Cajun legends. About a dozen 
          locals, speaking Creole French among other tongues, are being served 
          hot boudin, the uniquely Cajun sausage. I take a place in line, receive 
          the blessing, then speed away with my spicy links. Farther down the 
          road my enthusiasm is fueled by the sounds of live Zydeco on Breaux 
          Bridge radio, informing me that the annual Crawfish Festival has begun. 
          It is 9A.M. and time to party. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I follow 
          the music to David (dah veed) Olinde's Lounge. Inside the band is blaring 
          and about 20 couples are doing an ad hoc two step on tiny parcels of 
          dance floor. Pressed against the walls are more people, drinking, smoking, 
          and clapping to the raunchy rhythms. Through the smoky haze I can make 
          out a sign-&quot;Smoking Only!&quot; The sing-along is in French but 
          I have no trouble translating: <em>Laissez les bon temps roulez</em>! 
          (Let the good times roll!).</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Despite 
          decades of organized effort to assimilate Cajuns into American culture, 
          south Louisiana remains a gloriously unique and culturally diverse region. 
          Here you will find French, Spanish, West African, Caribbean, and many 
          others blended with Acadian. <font face="Georgia">This is perhaps most 
          apparent in the food and language. Where else would you have a beignet 
          for breakfast, a bowl of gumbo for lunch, and jambalaya for supper prior 
          to an evening of Zydeco at the fais do-do?</font></font></p>
