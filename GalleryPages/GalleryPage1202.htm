        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Easter 
          Island is the most remote inhabited place on earth. It lies 2300 miles 
          west of South America and 1300 miles east of Pitcairn Island, home to 
          the nearest neighbors. This lonely, tiny outpost is an obscure chapter 
          in the human story that just might reveal the way to grace for our species. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Dutch 
          &quot;discovered&quot; the island on Easter Sunday of 1722, thus the 
          name. What they found were embattled &quot;Stone Age&quot; clans engaged 
          in constant warfare and practicing slavery and cannibalism. Most lived 
          in caves hacked out of hillsides. These natives had no clue about the 
          great monuments and statuary that lay strewn about their tiny cosmos, 
          which told of a glorious past, and for which the island is now famous. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There 
          are no written or oral records so the mystery of Easter Island has had 
          to be unveiled by archaeologists sifting through the soil, petroglyphs, 
          and pollen. The truth comes hard. Sweeping conclusions come and go with 
          each new discovery. What follows is a simplistic account of what happened 
          to Polynesia's most advanced statement. There are many blank spaces 
          to fill. (next photo)</font></p>
