        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">My 
          final week on Hokkaido I ventured north to the Shiretoko Peninsula. 
          Here is a last vestige of wildness in Japan, as close to an &quot;end 
          of the earth&quot; experience as you're likely to find in this highly 
          populated nation. Here are mountains still covered by old growth forests, 
          with tumbling streams and pristine lakes. It all ends in a dramatic 
          coastline of black basalt and sparkling waterfalls. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          tip of the peninsula is a national park and refuge for some critters 
          not normally associated with Japan, including a rare brown bear or two. 
          It is also a holdout for one of the world's largest and most stunning 
          raptors, the Steller's sea eagle. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Eastern 
          Hokkaido is also a good place to witness the sometimes paradoxical effects 
          of wildlife protection. Sharing the forests of Shiretoko with the elusive 
          bears are thousands of Sika deer, a small creature with large eyes and 
          a haunting whistle. The deer have overrun much of Japan, the result 
          of a ban on hunting in 1888 and a lack of natural predators. With this 
          population surge has come forest defoliation and crop damage. This scenario 
          has a parallel in the United States with white tail deer and in Australia 
          with rabbits. And there are many others worldwide that tell the same 
          tale. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          this enlightened era of conservation man wants to control wildlife populations 
          and prevent extinctions. The goal is to maintain adequate numbers for 
          genetic diversity but not so many as to become a human pest. This &quot;volume&quot; 
          adjustment can be difficult to achieve in nature, as we've seen so often 
          in the past when we tamper with the balance of nature. Our best efforts 
          go awry and lead to ethical questions.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">How 
          does a crane's need for open wetland jive with our need for rice. When 
          do we deny ourselves the pleasure of interaction with a species and 
          would we still protect it if we never saw it? There are many others. 
          Environmental science and conservation biology attempt to answer these 
          difficult questions.</font></p>
