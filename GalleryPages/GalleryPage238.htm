        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Tibet 
          is described as &quot;one of the most spiritual places on earth,&quot; 
          and there is little room for argument. They pursue matters of the spirit 
          like we in the west pursue the material. To Tibetans religion is a daily 
          quest, an obsession. Most of them have little or no money and don't 
          seem to care.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Here 
          is simplicity brought to life. They eat only two meals per day, morning 
          and evening. Their fare, called tsampa, is a mix of roasted barley and 
          yak butter, carried in a pouch on their waist, which they wash down 
          with yak butter tea. The butter provides them a much needed energy boost 
          for life atop the &quot;the roof of the world.&quot; On rare special 
          occasions they will sacrifice a goat and roast it over a fire. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          Jokhang Temple, pictured above, is the most holy shrine in Tibetan Buddhism, 
          the equivalent of Mecca in Islam. Pilgrims spend months to years in 
          their travels to reach this site in Lhasa's Barkhor District. Along 
          the way they chant prayers, spin prayer wheels, and even prostrate themselves, 
          inchworming spreadeagle along the ground, sometimes for hundreds of 
          miles. The eeriness of all this spectacle is emphasized by the intentional 
          blur in this photograph.</font></p>
