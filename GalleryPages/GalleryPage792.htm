        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          Great Smoky Mountains National Park is 500,000 acres of Tennessee and 
          North Carolina, divided about equally between the two. It is the world's 
          most popular national park wth an estimated 15 million visitors per 
          year. To lend some perspective, our second most popular park is Grand 
          Canyon with seven million. Both parks are seriously overcrowded in high 
          season and face the difficult prospect of having to limit visitation. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          road to Cherokee, on the Carolina side, is a long corridor of cheap 
          motels, fast-food restaurants, trailer parks, and junky gas stations, 
          perched on the edge of a perfect stream. It must have been a beautiful 
          valley once, before the indelible stamp of man arrived. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And 
          the town is worse, centerpiece of the largest Indian reservation in 
          the east and a gauntlet of shops selling cheap souvenirs. For sale are 
          moccasins, tomahawks, and other Indian paraphernalia. But to top it 
          off, and for a few bucks, you can have a photo made with a genuine, 
          hung-over, pot-bellied Cherokee Indian in war dress. I pass on the golden 
          opportunity. And apparently so do most other vistors as the warriors 
          are mostly slumped and asleep in front of their respective emporia. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          driving out of Cherokee and into the Smokies is something else. The 
          tacky town ends abruptly, as if by decree, and the park begins. There 
          is little left of the hand of man in these half million acres, finally 
          something to be thankful for. There has to be some respite from tawdry 
          billboards and caged black bears strategically placed to swindle hard 
          earned tourist dollars. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          Oconaluftee Highway across the mountains is 30 miles and several hours 
          of pure joy. It winds through a dappled broad-leaved forest, some of 
          it still virgin, under singing skies, across dancing waters, just like 
          the brochure said. Every so often are lookout points so I can pull over 
          and yodel at the views. The mountains fade to a distant horizon, colored 
          in green and blue under the famed smoky haze for which this park is 
          named. In the rolling vastness of trees there is not one sign of humanity, 
          not a single house or road spoils my view. My only companions are silence 
          and the crystalline sky, clear but for a far-off puff of cumulus, drifting 
          along and casting a shadow on some unnamed peak.</font></p>
