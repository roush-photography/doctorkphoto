        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">If 
          Columbus had discovered the eastern U.S. rather than Hispaniola in 1492, 
          he would have been confronted by nearly a billion acres of trees. This 
          menacing deciduous forest spread nearly unbroken from northern Alabama 
          and Georgia to the far reaches of Canada, and from the Atlantic seaboard 
          to the Mississippi River. It ranks as one of the great temperate woods 
          of all time.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Compared 
          to other developed countries America is still a land of trees. Most 
          would agree this is a happy fact, though some, I'm sure, would argue 
          that there's too much chlorophyll and not enough concrete in the world. 
          Who needs all that oxygen anyway? Perhaps half of that original woodland 
          remains, though Boone and Crockett would not recognize their old haunts. 
          Huge swaths are spindly second and third growth forests. Much of the 
          rest are cultivated trees found in suburban parks and backyards, often 
          non-native species. They provide seasonal decor for our manicured world. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">About 
          250 million acres, or half, of this wooded realm is owned by the government, 
          specifically the U.S. Forest Service, and under the designation of National 
          Forests. Most of us assume that the Forest Service will take care of 
          our forests in a sort of kindly and paternal way, and provide us with 
          shady woodlands and trails for the future. This was the &quot;visionary 
          plan&quot; conceived about a century ago when a few enlightened souls 
          did the math. Simple enough-cut all the trees down and there won't be 
          any left. This seemed like a really bad result, so our visionary planners 
          came up with the idea of designating our national forests as reserves, 
          to serve as &quot;nature banks&quot; and provide trees, wildlife, clean 
          water, and other things natural for posterity. Unfortunately they couldn't 
          factor greed into all their high-minded plans and equations. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Instead 
          of reserves these Forest Service lands have been designated &quot;multiple 
          use,&quot; which allows a number of patently unecological activities-grazing, 
          mining, oil and gas extraction, and development of ski resorts and condominiums 
          to name but a few. And of course there's all that &quot;scientific forestry,&quot; 
          a two bit term for <em>clear-cutting</em>, including thousands of acres 
          of thousand year old redwood trees along the California coast. They 
          kept cutting until only about 3% of those original trees remain (there's 
          that math again). And they'll get those too, if we let them. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And 
          here's the thing. All of these activities are carried out through leasing 
          arrangements to private companies, <em>at a loss to the govenment</em>, 
          specifically you and me since we're the taxpayers. And this is business 
          as usual! The way it has always been done. In one recent decade, according 
          to the Wilderness Society, our Forest Service lost two billion dollars 
          with their pathetic math skills. If they're going to rape our forests 
          at least we should be getting paid market price for it. Better yet, 
          revert to the original concept of the Forest Service and manage our 
          forests sensibly, before it's too late. </font></p>
