        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          American West, its great mountains, deserts, and canyons, is a wilderness 
          that should be experienced with body and spirit, not by staring at a 
          picture, painting, or screen. It is an international treasure too valuable 
          to be sacrificed for short-term gain. The wildness and emptiness of 
          this land is its greatest appeal and must be preserved for all time, 
          for those who seek adventure in a physical, spiritual, or aesthetic 
          sense. This is a place for the free. Here we may still relish that sweet, 
          lucent air, wander over yonder in solitude, and gaze across red canyons, 
          blue mesas, and purple mountains. This is the America of dreams and 
          anthems. </font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          sifting of water between rock for impossible periods of time throughout 
          the American West has created the world's most fantastic landscapes. 
          It is my favorite destination on the planet and what I like to imagine 
          heaven will be like.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Antelope 
          Canyon, near Page in northern Arizona, is an &quot;A-frame&quot; slot 
          canyon carved out of red sandstone into phantasmagorical shapes and 
          colors. It lies in a remote part of the northern Grand Canyon system. 
          The walls of Antelope give a daily performance that is orchestrated 
          by the migration of the sun across the brillant blue desert sky. Light 
          sneaks in through the tiny slot above, at various angles depending on 
          the time of day and the season, and bounces around the sliced walls 
          to create the kaleidoscopic show.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          highlight for photographers occurs at high noon when the sun appears 
          briefly as a spotlight to illuminate levitating dust and the silence 
          of the canyon floor. Or just possibly, a canyon angel! (next photo)</font></p>
