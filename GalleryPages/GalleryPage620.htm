        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And I 
          may have gotten here just in the nick of time! <em>Panthera tigris </em>is 
          on the brink. The world's most charismatic animal faces certain extinction 
          in the wild without drastic intervention. The story is grim. In 1900 
          there were an estimated 100,000 tigers in east Asia. Today there are 
          fewer than 3,000, barely hanging on in scattered reserves that have 
          only token law enforcement. The tiger's former range included 24 countries. 
          Today tigers are found in only 13 and several of those are dubious. 
          The light went out for the Bali tiger in 1940, the Javan and Caspian 
          tigers in the 1970s, and most recently the Cambodian tiger in 2010. 
          The Chinese tiger probably exists only in a few zoos. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
          ray of hope appeared in the seventies when India's Project Tiger resulted 
          in a decade of population increases. But this was short lived. With 
          the passing of Indira Gandhi, an era of enlightened conservation came 
          to an end. And tiger numbers began to plummet once again. This is largely 
          due to a surge in poaching to supply eastern Asia's burgeoning middle 
          class with animal parts for traditional medicine. <em>Tiger penis soup 
          to make the Chinese more virile</em>. Just what the world needs! A single 
          tiger can bring $150,000 from this lucrative market. Every ounce of 
          this magnificant beast is sliced up or ground up and sold for something. 
          This would hardly be acceptable if the treatments were effective, which 
          they are NOT. So, much of the world's wildlife (tiger, elephant, panda, 
          and many others) is being exterminated simply to placate Asia's ignorance 
          and superstition!</font></p>
