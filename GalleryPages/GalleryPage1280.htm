          take to industrialism after the manner of the West. <br>
          If our nation took to similar exploitation, it would strip the world 
          bare like locusts.<br>

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As 
          I left the side of Mother Ganges I felt a lump in my throat, a definite 
          twinge of sadness. I had been witness to the most intimate rites of 
          life and death in this holy city of Varanasi (Benares during British 
          rule), the city of Shiva, the culmination of 5000 years of Indian history 
          untainted by European meddling. This was India at the dawn of the 21st 
          century, with her common courtesy, the wink of an eye, and her impossible 
          dilemma. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As 
          I walked the streets one last time, crowded with Hinduism, I encountered 
          more of this nation that is an assault on the Western senses: shabby 
          kids with bright eyes and head lice; homeless people sleeping on the 
          streets with mangy dogs; women working; men not working; pregnant women 
          carrying huge top loads; men squatting, talking politics, and spitting; 
          the smell of urine and piles of poop everywhere; and hordes of sad faced 
          people wandering waywardly about. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">India 
          is a place to expect the unexpected, which makes travel there so difficult, 
          and yet so inimitibly fascinating at the same time. Love it or hate 
          it (and I did both), India jostles all of you, body and soul. After 
          a month I was ready to go home, and after a month at home I was ready 
          to go back. Somehow India knows this, and thus the wink. </font></p>
