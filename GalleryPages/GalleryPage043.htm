      <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
        am backpacking in the Brooks Range of Alaska. It is early autumn. From 
        a lofty vantage I gaze across a mile wide valley, carved by the raging 
        torrent that is my immediate concern. I must get to the other side. The 
        river is &quot;milky&quot; with glacial silt so I can only guess the depth. 
        I tote a 60 pound pack, and cameras, to make things even more interesting.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
        secure clothes and cameras in plastic and hoist the pack, leaving straps 
        unsecured, just in case I need to jettison my precious gear. It's hard 
        to imagine being that desperate, but it beats drowning. At least alive 
        I have options, albeit few that are appealing without gear. I take a bold 
        step into the icy melt and feel the current dig away the gravelly foundation 
        beneath my bare feet. By midstream I am waist deep and losing the feel 
        of everything underwater. Progress in infinitesimal. I begin to panic, 
        which summons a surge of adrenaline. I thank my adrenal glands for the 
        help.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Finally 
        I heave my exhausted body onto the blessed opposite bank and pant desperately 
        as I thank the river gods for safe deliverance. It was way more risk than 
        I bargained for but I had emerged unscathed, more or less. Unless you 
        count whimpering. Surely I must be wiser for the wear. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As 
        I lay still I feel warm-blooded life slowly return to my lower half. In 
        a semi-trance I watch the sun, red and enormous, set in the western sky 
        and the moon rise opposite. The sounds of wind and river compliment the 
        celestial dance and I reach into the pack for my tent. I can't think of 
        a better place to spend an evening.</font></p>
