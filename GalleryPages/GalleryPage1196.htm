        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
          humans are totally dependent on a healthy planet, and yet mother nature 
          is so generous that most of us live our lives without giving her a second 
          thought. At the most basic level, all of our foodstuff comes from nature. 
          Only plants can manufacture food from &quot;raw materials.&quot; But 
          plants and animals throughout history have also provided man with clothing, 
          shelter, tools, fuel, timber, oils, dyes, and myriad other products. 
          It is estimated that 25% of modern medicines are derived from plants 
          as are all high-yield food crops responsible for the recent &quot;green 
          revolution.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          We have only just begun to tap the potential genetic and bioengineering 
          benefits that might be derived from even the most obscure of species, 
          few of which have been adequately studied. For example, the naked mole 
          rat of Africa, a blind, underground, hairless, and (some would say) 
          hideous creature that lives the human equivalent of a thousand years 
          and does not get cancer! We know little else about this amazing species. 
          What other secrets are out there, burrowing around in the dirt?</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Nature 
          and biodiversity also exert a profound spiritual and aesthetic impact 
          on people, a benefit hard to put a dollar value on, so it is mostly 
          ignored in political circles. The presence of life animates our world 
          and enhances our emotional response to it. The complexity of the aesthetic 
          response is suggested by the variety of inspirations, from a mountain 
          stream in the Great Smokies to a hummingbird in California to the wonder 
          of the Grand Canyon in Arizona. These experiences evoke intense feelings 
          in us-feelings of joy, rapture, and even transcendence. Such mystical 
          events are among the most sought-after by our species and are often 
          provoked by the sudden insight that all things are one. From such epiphanies 
          came the enlightenment of Christ and Muhammad as they wandered in the 
          desert, and Lord Buddha as he meditated under the Bodhi tree. Some things 
          are priceless!</font></p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For 
          several years this Anna's hummingbird has returned to Morro Bay, California 
          after a few months of soaking up the sun in Baja, Mexico. He &quot;maps&quot; 
          his territory by flashing this remarkable display, designed to keep 
          other males away, flying in a circuit to the same tree branches, day 
          after day, year after year, to do so. The purple neck and fanned tail 
          last for a split second, disappear, and then he's off to the next branch 
          to repeat the performance. He doesn't seem to mind photographers at 
          all. They keep coming back year after year, following him around, and 
          trying to capture the ephemeral beauty. It took two full mornings of 
          frenzied shooting before I was finally successful.</font></p>
