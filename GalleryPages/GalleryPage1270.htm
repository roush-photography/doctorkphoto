          first time, I heard a gold mining generator across the river. <br>
          Dr. Birute Galdikas</em></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Until 
          the mid 1900s Borneo was one of the great jungles on earth, a heart 
          of darkness, dripping, teeming, ripe, and risky. The kind of place that 
          made Joseph Conrad's pen restless. This emerald island, third largest 
          in the world after Greenland and New Guinea, was largely unexplored 
          until then, a land of legend that aroused fear in great white hunters. 
          Here lurked lost tribes of headhunters and man-eating apes called <em>ut-ut</em>.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          that was then. The Borneo of today has gone from the Stone Age to mobile 
          phones in the last 25 years. There are bustling towns, scheduled flights, 
          and even sporadic electricity. Conspicuously absent are neon lights, 
          glitzy cities, and most trappings of 21st century pop culture. Coca-cola 
          is here but fast food is not. Prepare to eat rice three times a day 
          if you go, and boiled chicken twice. Not bad for a few days. Paved roads 
          are only in the towns. All other travel is by foot or boat.</font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          begin a visit to Borneo in the harbor city of Pangkalan Bun, staging 
          area for trips into the jungle. I am in search of the elusive orangutan, 
          mythical &quot;man of the forest.&quot; My final destination is Tanjung 
          Puting National Park, home of Camp Leakey, the research station of Birute 
          Galdikas, who has been living with and studying these great apes for 
          decades. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">On 
          the second morning I awaken fresh and eager to explore this wild kingdom. 
          My guide and I board a <em>klotuk</em>, the standard river cruiser in 
          these parts, and set sail for the Sekonyer River which will take us 
          to Camp Leakey, two days upriver. I park myself on the top deck to search 
          for wildlife and wild humans. Hours pass and I see nothing of interest, 
          not a single bird, snake, monkey, or head hunter. Only an occasional 
          sad-faced fisherman, dressed in tattered Western garb. They catch no 
          fish as we slowly motor by. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">At 
          the end of the day my sightings list consists of a few more sad-faced 
          fishermen, three proboscis monkeys, and a single hornbill. And that's 
          it for an entire day in the jungle, the most biodiverse ecosystem on 
          the planet. I am stunned. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          complain to my Indonesian guide who informs me that wildlife has mostly 
          disappeared from this area after construction of a massive gold mine 
          on the Sekonyer, well past Camp Leakey. The mine employs 800 locals. 
          Try to imagine their paychecks, and then who gets the gold. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          the mining and smelting processes huge quantities of mercury are released 
          into air and river, poisoning the entire food chain, top to bottom, 
          all the way downriver to the sea. This includes people, but who cares 
          with all that gold for the taking. The only thing that really matters 
          around here is another regime in Jakarta getting filthy rich, and closing 
          their eyes to the poverty and environmental desecration in their country. 
          The Sekonyer River has become another Love Canal. I am penetrating a 
          toxic dump, not a heart of darkness. </font></p>
