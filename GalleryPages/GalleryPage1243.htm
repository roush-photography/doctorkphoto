        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I am backpacking 
          alone in the Brooks Range of Alaska. It is early autumn, late evening. 
          From a lofty vantage I gaze across a mile wide valley, carved by the 
          raging river that is my immediate concern. I must get to the other side 
          to reach Folly Lake by tomorrow afternoon, when a floatplane will pick 
          me up and carry me back to civilization. I love this place, but I'm 
          almost out of food and it's time to go home. The river is &quot;milky&quot; 
          with glacial silt so I can't see the bottom, which means, of course, 
          I have no clue how deep it is. I tote a 60 pound pack, and cameras, 
          to make things even more interesting.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I secure 
          clothes and cameras in plastic and hoist the pack, leaving straps unbuckled, 
          just in case I need to jettison my precious gear. It's hard to imagine 
          being that desperate, but it beats drowning. At least alive I have options, 
          albeit few that are appealing without gear. I take a bold step into 
          the icy melt and feel the current dig away the gravel beneath my sandals. 
          By midstream I am waist deep and losing the feel of everything immersed. 
          Progress is infinitesimal. I'm not panicky, but almost, which summons 
          a surge of adrenaline that makes my step quicken. I am grateful for 
          the help. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Finally, 
          I heave my exhausted body onto the blessed opposite bank and pant desperately 
          as I thank the river gods for safe deliverance. It was far more risk 
          than I bargained for but I am unscathed, more or less (unless you count 
          whimpering). As I lay still, I feel warm-blooded life slowly return 
          to my lower half. In a semi-trance I watch the sun, red and enormous, 
          seek a resting place in the western sky, and the moon awaken opposite 
          to begin its nocturnal trek. The sounds of wind and river compliment 
          the celestial dance and I reach into the pack for stove and tent. What 
          better place to spend a night?</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As the 
          photo demonstrates, I made it to Folly Lake on time. During the flight 
          back to Bettles I snapped this picture of the transition between tundra 
          and taiga, blazing in fall colors. And yes, I did see several grizzlies 
          while backpacking, but all at a distance. </font></p>
