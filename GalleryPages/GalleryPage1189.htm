        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          environmental movement is less than 60 years old but its roots date 
          back to the late nineteenth century. The story begins with the tales 
          of four species. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          year 2014 marked the centennial commemoration of the extraordinary extinction 
          of the passenger pigeon. For centuries this pigeon was believed to be 
          indestructible, the most abundant bird in North America, and probably 
          the world, with numbers estimated in the billions. Yet this remarkably 
          successful species was extinguished in just three decades by human exploitation. 
          The last documented passenger pigeon in the wild was in 1900, in Ohio. 
          Martha, the sole surviving captive bird, lived an additional 14 years 
          at the Cincinnati Zoo. On September 2nd, at the ripe old age of 17, 
          she died, one of the few extinctions ever to be witnessed &quot;live.&quot; 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          Martha would not go quietly. This extinction caused reverberations. 
          She and her kind became a rallying cry for a budding new morality in 
          this country that believed it was just <em>wrong</em> for man to indiscriminately 
          annihilate a species for fun and profit. The passenger pigeon became 
          a symbol of staggering abundance on the one hand and human greed and 
          callousness on the other. </font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
          picture is a good example of storytelling in photography. At first glance 
          it is a happy story. It shows a moose and calf wading the Colorado River 
          near its source in the Rocky Mountains. Public lands, such as national 
          parks, national forests, and others have helped to keep this nation 
          &quot;green&quot; and biodiverse, with many threatened species returning 
          from the brink. For example, the moose was extinct in Colorado until 
          its reintroduction only recently. With protection numbers have increased 
          rapidly, and there is now a limited hunting season. <br>
          <br>
          But a closer look at this photograph reveals a not-so-happy side to 
          the story. The devastating effects of the pine bark beetle are obvious 
          in the background. Virtually all lodgepole pine trees in Rocky Mountain 
          National Park have succumbed to the effects of the beetle. This is due 
          to multiple changes in the environment brought on by global warming. 
          The infestation is expected to effect all species of conifers (spruce, 
          fir, and pine) in the Rocky Mountains<font face="Georgia">, from Alaska 
          to Mexico. The worst prognosis is near 100 percent mortality of every 
          species during the next few decades. (next photo)</font></font></p>
