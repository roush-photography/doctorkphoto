        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As 
          Malaysia celebrates her golden anniversary of independence she is riding 
          a hi-tech wave of affluence, having gone from Genesis to the internet 
          practically overnight. This economic transition is as stunning as all 
          the recent racial harmony. For nearly a century the people of this little 
          country were enslaved to supply the British Crown with tin, timber, 
          rubber, and palm oil, while getting little in return. But independent 
          Malaysia quickly found out it could do better. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          the 1980s, seduced by an untapped labor force with a puritan-style work 
          ethic, foreign investors in technology, mostly from the U.S., poured 
          their dollars into this Asian dynamo. The Malaysian electronics industry 
          was born and now leads the world in the production of integrated circuits 
          and other semiconductor devices. With an annual growth rate at an impressive 
          8% she stands atop the Asian pedestal with the likes of Japan and Korea. 
          Take that, Your Highness!</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          another in-your-face gesture, this time to the U.S. and the rest of 
          the Western world, Malaysia flexed her muscles and constructed, not 
          one, but twin towers in Kuala Lumpur that were taller than the Sears 
          in Chicago. The Petronas Towers loom like menacing missiles over a nation 
          whose confidence borders on contempt for the West. There is a firm belief, 
          not only in Malaysia but in much of east Asia, that the balance of power 
          is shifting their way, toward an &quot;Asian Century.&quot; These nations 
          boast higher growth rates, lower crime rates, lower drug use, and greater 
          family stability than the Eurocentric world. Take that Western world.</font></p>
