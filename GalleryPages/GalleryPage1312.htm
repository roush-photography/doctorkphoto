        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          am in the South American jungle, at the muddy outpost of Puerto Maldonado, 
          capital of eastern Peru. It's a gold rush town with a distinctly frontier 
          feel, like Tombstone, only muggier. I, too, am on the hunt, but not 
          for gold. I come in search of rainbows, of the feathered variety, the 
          rowdy and regal lords of squawk. I'm talking about parrots and macaws. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
          is the heart of Amazonia, perhaps the most accessible godforsaken spot 
          on the planet. The only highway in these parts is the Rio Madre de Dios, 
          a tributary of the mighty Amazon. A two day journey upriver, through 
          a 50 thousand square mile (the size of Arkansas) &quot;heart of darkness,&quot; 
          will bring me to Tambopata, home of the world's largest known clay lick. 
          This 100-foot wall, scoured by flood and rain, rises abruptly from the 
          river's edge. When sunrise clears the morning mist and illuminates the 
          great wall, it triggers one of the most dazzling avian spectacles in 
          the world. A raucous crowd of parrots and macaws, thousands of them, 
          will fill the sky, then splatter their rainbow colors on the good earth, 
          to screech, squabble, and eat clay (lots of theories but no one really 
          knows why). And I have a front-row seat and telephoto lens for the show.</font></p>

          Scientists puzzle over this phenomenon, theorizing the birds need the 
          soil for minerals they lack, or to neutralize poisons in various seeds 
          they eat. These beautiful birds have long been threatened by collection 
          for the pet industry. On the plus side the Tambopata region has recently 
          been declared a national park and former hunters are being enlisted 
          as guides for ecotourists. </font></p>
