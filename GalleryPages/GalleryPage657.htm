          mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.<br>
          Henry David Thoreau</font></em></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
          highway leads from Kampala, in Uganda, toward Lake Victoria. It could 
          be any highway in most any poor country, lined with factories for mile 
          after mile. Each morning crowds of tired men dressed in tattered clothes 
          gather outside the factories. They have been &quot;hired,&quot; which 
          means they must show up every day at the factory, and sometimes they 
          get to work, sometimes not. Having a job doesn't mean work in Uganda. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          am on a hiking expedition in this poor east African country, and my 
          guide's brother is one of these desperate souls. On our way out of town 
          we stop and talk with him as he waits for the gate to open. He has worked 
          here for several months, a long time by Ugandan standards. He walks 
          five miles to work from one of Kampala's many shantytowns. When the 
          factory is busy he will work six days a week, 10 hours a day, for about 
          $50 a month (25 cents and hour). Most months are not that busy. On a 
          good day he has the ten schillings (15 cents) to buy a meager lunch 
          of corn and beans. Most days are not that good. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Unions 
          are not allowed in the factories. Any talk of unions will get you fired. 
          Good-by for good. Anyone complaining about an injury or illness is also 
          fired. The hiring lines are long when there is 40% unemployment. Agitators 
          come easy, and go easy. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          factories are dangerous places too. Masks are not available when there 
          is toxic dust. Protective gear is non-existent. Limbs and lives are 
          lost, without much complaint. Complaining is hazardous to one's job. 
          Men need work to support their families. No wonder so many turn to a 
          life of crime. Or poaching.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There 
          are thousands of these factories all over Africa and still these are 
          the poorest and most underemployed nations in the world. The root cause 
          of this misery is overpopulation, too many people and not enough jobs. 
          Simple math. </font></p>
