          this fabulous hominid was not content to merely adapt to a changing 
          world. He was about to break the rules, in fact to shatter them to smithereens. 
          About 10,000 years ago man began to do something that had never been 
          done. He began to modify rather than adapt to his environment, making 
          the world fit his needs rather than the other way around. Instead of 
          just hunting and gathering man learned to domesticate plants to eat, 
          and animals to eat and do his work for him. He became a farmer and a 
          shepherd. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thus 
          the seeds of an agricultural revolution were planted in a fertile crescent 
          around the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, in present day Iraq. This was 
          mankind's real &quot;giant leap,&quot; the single most important chapter 
          in the incomparable biography of <em>Homo sapiens</em>. Man was set 
          to graze, plow, hydrate, and populate the entire planet, and one day 
          take another giant step. In 1969 man placed his footprints on the moon. 
          Truly a job well done! All we have to do now is deal with the consequences 
          of all that success.</font></p>
