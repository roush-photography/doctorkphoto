        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Geographically 
          Borneo, the world's third largest island, is way out there. Between 
          the South China and Java Seas, its quadrants are unfamiliar to most 
          Westerners. Over the years, however, a few have managed to stumble across 
          her lucrative paths. The white man's history in Borneo is very recent 
          and very typical. The island has been a hotspot of plunder by the usual 
          plunderers from around the world for the last century. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          Chinese came first, in the late 1800's, for rhinoceros horn. As an aphrodisiac, 
          of course. What else would you do with a rhino's horn? After they killed 
          all the rhino, they settled for bird's nest to make soup (for real). 
          This practice continues today, though the harvest is somewhat regulated 
          and carried out by locals, a modest improvement over the past. After 
          the Chinese came the Brits, and the beginning of the end for the island's 
          tropical hardwood forests. In the last half of the 20th century the 
          Americans finally came on board, plundering what they plunder best, 
          oil and natural gas. Many mansions in the U.S. were built with wealth 
          from Borneo. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          big island today is politically divided by Indonesia and Malaysia, and 
          they are the biggest plunderers of all, especially the fat cat scoundrels 
          in Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur. The story is a desperate one for Borneo's 
          incomparable lowland rain forests, home to most of the island's biodiversity, 
          including elephants, orangutans, and native people. Scientists warn 
          of &quot;dire consequences&quot; from the &quot;current state of resource 
          anarchy,&quot; as the forests fall at a clip of two million acres a 
          year. At this rate the Texas sized island will soon be totally deforested, 
          having been stripped bare in less than half a century!</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Indigenous 
          peoples around the world, Australian aboriginals, Dani in New Guinea, 
          Dayak in Borneo, and others are being marginalized or assimilated. In 
          either case their traditional ways are disrupted and they do not fare 
          well, struggling to adapt to the modern world. In many cases their entire 
          history, which is also our history, is lost forever. </font></p>
