          I am a simple Buddhist monk<br>

          His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama</font></em></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Earth 
          has been called the Living Planet, and for good reason. An amazing diversity 
          of life resides on this tiny blue orb as she floats through the black 
          of space. The number of species has been estimated between <em>30 and 
          100 million! </em>Only 1.7 million of them have been &quot;discovered&quot; 
          and classified.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          spite of this incredible diversity of form and function, the fundamental 
          similarity of all life is equally as remarkable. Living things share 
          a basic cellular, biomolecular, and genetic structure, indicating common 
          roots. We are astonished to learn that we share 99% of our DNA with 
          a chimp (or is it the other way around?), but what about 40% with an 
          earthworm? On a quantum level life consists of protons, neutrons, electrons, 
          bosons, and quarks, surrounded by mostly empty space. To a chemist a 
          carbon atom is a carbon atom, whether it comes from a human or a snail. 
          What a grand mystery!</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
          shared design suggests to many a purpose and spirituality to life on 
          earth. Call it God, the Tao, or whatever, it provides order and harmony 
          to our often frenzied lives. And it promotes a sense of connectivity 
          to other people and to nature. This profound understanding then influences 
          conduct. Morality becomes an imperative. The basic kinship binding all 
          life together demands that we minimize harm to other species, as the 
          Buddhists have been saying for 2500 years. </font></p>
