          when you think you've heard it all, ponder this. Wispy monarch butterflies, 
          fluttering northerly over the United States in summertime, finally arrive 
          in Canada in early autumn. They have migrated from central Mexico in 
          40 day life cycles. This latest generation of butterflies, however, 
          detects the autumnal ebb in the photoperiod and makes an abrupt u-turn 
          to fly south. These native Canadians draw a bead on a single mountaintop 
          in Mexico, 2500 miles away. With beating wings and the grace of god, 
          they are soon there, resting in the same Oyamel fir trees as their forebears 
          did. <em>Six months and many generations ago</em>! Truly one of nature's 
          most amazing tales. How on earth?</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">British 
          Naval Captain James Cook is considered by many to be the greatest of 
          human navigators. But is this really so? His credentials are definitely 
          impressive. He sailed around the world twice and explored much of the 
          Pacific Ocean in the mid 1700's, before anyone else had done so. Cook 
          used the technology of his time, a compass, a sextant, and the stars 
          to find his way over the vast oceans.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          1769 Cook received a detailed map from Polynesians in Tahiti of all 
          the major islands of the South Pacific, most he had never seen or heard 
          of. Obviously they'd sailed these waters for a long time. Tupaia, a 
          Tahitian priest, then joined Cook on his ship, the Endeavor, and proceeded 
          to dazzle the British captain and crew by taking them to unknown and 
          faraway islands, without the use of navigational aids. By dead reckoning 
          only. <em>Just like the monarch butterfly</em>!</font></p>

          who's the greatest navigator of the all?</font></p>
