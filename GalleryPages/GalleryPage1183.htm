          Galen Rowell (Photographer)</font></em></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia">We humans have long regarded ourselves 
          a superior species. I'm not so sure. Intelligent? Yes. Wise? Hmm. It 
          all depends on how you look at it, I suppose. The scientists among us 
          attribute this &quot;superiority&quot; to our massive forebrain, bipedal 
          gait, and opposable thumbs. Makes sense. But perhaps the strongest indicator 
          of a higher evolution has been the emergence of mind. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">Not only do we want to 
          survive, we want to thrive. We harnessed the power of fire for warmth 
          and cooking, then began to dance to the motion of the flames on a cold 
          winter night. Food, a necessity for survival, gradually evolved into 
          an art form, a centerpiece of society which we consume for pleasure 
          almost as much as sustenance. Musical notes and rhythm morphed from 
          simple signals to Mozart. Oral tradition became legend, poetry, and 
          wit. Virtually all humans seek beauty in their lives, with a plant, 
          a painting, or a poem. We dance, hum, and arrange, and when really moved, 
          we want to preserve a memory. Enter photography!</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">Photographs are proof 
          that we have lived and loved, that we have experienced. Only recently 
          has this magical medium allowed us to know what our parents looked like 
          as children, to acquaint us with their pimples and freckles, and to 
          see the one-room schoolhouse they attended. And to not only observe, 
          but to hold dear and forever our own child's first breath. Such pictures 
          are indescribably important to us, universally said to be among the 
          first things we would rescue from a burning home.</font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">People are the most common 
          subjects in photography. Number two is nature (notwithstanding that 
          they are one and the same). Combining the two was one of the late Galen 
          Rowell's favorite compositional techniques, although he preferred rock 
          climbing in Yosemite to beachcombing in Belize as a backdrop.</font></p>
