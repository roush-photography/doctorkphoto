        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Since 
          life began on earth, four billion years ago, there have been five known 
          mass extinction events when much of life was eliminated in a geologically 
          brief period. </font><font size="4" face="Georgia">The last of these 
          took place 65 million years ago and until recently was a mystery to 
          scholars. We now know that the Age of Reptiles, about 100 million years 
          of earth time, came to a screeching halt when a massive asteroid collided 
          with the planet off the Yucatan coast of Mexico. This earth shattering 
          event led to tsunamis, fire storms, and cataclysmic climate upheaval. 
          T. rex never had a chance. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">The sixth mass extinction 
          crisis is currently in progress and is unique. It is the only such event 
          driven, not by geology, climate, or astronomy, but by a single living 
          force-<em>Homo sapiens</em>! The inescapable truth is shocking. Through 
          direct persecution or habitat destruction humankind will bring about 
          the demise of 25 to 50% of earth's species in the current century. We 
          are the most awesome force for change the earth has ever known, greater 
          even than asteroids or volcanoes. We got this way mostly in the last 
          century, by explosive population growth and an acceleration of the scientific 
          and technological revolution which increased our power to burn, cut, 
          dig, move, and otherwise transform the physical earth. And that has 
          made us the most potent extinction force in 65 million years. Maybe 
          of all time. We are king of the mountain, until one day..........? </font></p>
