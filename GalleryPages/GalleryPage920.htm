          of the more remote and culturally distinct people I have visited was, 
          ironically enough, in the crowded melting pot of Indonesia. In the central 
          highlands of Sulawesi, a large orchid-shaped island formerly known as 
          the Celebes, are the Tana Toraja people. Isolated by the sea and hemmed 
          in by imposing mountains, the Toraja have lived for centuries in a rigidly 
          stratified caste system ruled by a small nobility. They have long resisted 
          outside influence. And though the modern world, with roads, cell phones, 
          and fast food is knocking at the door, the ancient past is still gloriously 
          present here. This is most evident in their religion, a blend of Christianity 
          and ancestor worship nestled within a nation of Islam, with hedonistic 
          ceremonies that celebrate life, and most especially death.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">From 
          a lofty vantage point Tarajaland is like gazing over a giant golf course 
          with a hundred thousand groundskeepers scurrying to and fro while buffalo 
          peacefully graze about (see photo above). Every square inch is meticulously 
          crafted by the hand of man. Laced with footpaths, manicured rice terraces, 
          and islands of bamboo and palm trees, there is something serene and 
          enchanting about this emerald enclave. It was as if I had stumbled upon 
          Shangri-la. Only the plane was missing. (next photo)</font></p>
