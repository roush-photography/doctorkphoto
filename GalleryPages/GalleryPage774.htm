        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
          striking assemblage of wildlife takes place each year in Japan. Who'd 
          of thunk it? The spectacle occurs only in winter and only on the far 
          northern island of Hokkaido. Planeloads of visitors fly each season 
          from the far reaches of the planet, then board buses and trains to scattered 
          refuges on this least settled of Japan's main islands. Here, in this 
          single imposing season, gather Steller's sea eagles (photo above), whooper 
          swans, and red crowned cranes. All three are rare, having been hunted 
          to the brink or evicted from their natural habitats by human pressures. 
          The crane is in the agonal twilight of its existence and survives only 
          through the last ditch efforts of a few local wildlife heroes. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">My 
          January flight took me 14 hours from Atlanta to Tokyo. We flew, not 
          in a straight line, but an arc across the frozen north of Canada, Alaska, 
          and finally eastern Siberia to our destination. There I joined a gaggle 
          of bird watchers and photographers and we headed north to Kushiro, land 
          of the red crowned crane, or <em>tancho</em>, as the Japanese say.</font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          field is snow white bordered by woods of nearly blue evergreen. The 
          regal cranes cluster in the wide open space, nearly a hundred of them. 
          White tailed eagles, red fox, and whooper swans patrol, waiting to pilfer 
          the fare of fish and corn provided the cranes by local farmers. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thought 
          to be extinct at the turn of last century, a few of the birds were &quot;rediscovered&quot; 
          in 1924 to much national fanfare. It was at this time that the farmers 
          took an interest and began the charity that has certainly revived the 
          species, at least for now. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Across 
          the way a few of the cranes strut across the field showing their colors. 
          Others stand in pairs and point bills skyward, in tandem, to trumpet 
          a shrill cry that carries far in the razor quiet of winter. One rustles 
          its wings and arches its back in a display meant to disburse the competition. 
          It fails. There is food to be had. A triplet of cranes descends on motionless 
          wings from a roost in the nearby wood. They touch down deftly and begin 
          to pluck at the scattered corn. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Those 
          of us pressed against the rail, smiles wide and cameras in hand, are 
          grateful to have this season with the cranes, perhaps gathered here 
          for a final curtain call. (Next photo)</font></p>
