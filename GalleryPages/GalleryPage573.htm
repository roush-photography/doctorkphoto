        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia">We humans have long regarded ourselves 
          a superior species. I'm not so sure. Intelligent-yes. Wise-hmmm? It 
          all depends on how you look at it I suppose. More on this later. The 
          scientists among us attribute this &quot;superiority&quot; to our massive 
          forebrain, bipedal gait, and opposable thumbs. Makes sense. But perhaps 
          the strongest indicator of a higher evolution has been the emergence 
          of mind. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">Not only do we want to 
          survive, we want to thrive. We harnessed the power of fire for warmth 
          and cooking, then became mesmerized by its dancing flames on a cold 
          winter night. Food, a necessity for survival, gradually evolved into 
          an artform, a centerpiece of society, which we consume for pleasure 
          as much as sustenance. Musical notes and rhythm morphed from simple 
          communication to Mozart. Oral tradition became legend, poetry, and wit. 
          Virtually all humans seek beauty in their lives, with a plant, a painting, 
          or a poem. We dance, hum, and arrange, and when really moved we want 
          to preserve a memory. Enter photography!</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">Photographs are proof 
          that we have lived and loved, that we have experienced. Only recently 
          has this magical medium allowed us to know what our parents looked like 
          as children, to acquaint us with their pimples and freckles, to see 
          the one room schoolhouse of <em>their</em> parents. And to not only 
          observe, but to hold dear and forever our own child's first breath. 
          Such pictures are indescribably important to us, universally said to 
          be among the first things we would rescue from a burning home.</font></p>
