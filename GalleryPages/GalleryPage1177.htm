          don't have a visceral recollection<br>
          of a Kennedy and a King assassination, a Beatles breakup,<br>
          a U.S. defeat in Vietnam, and a Watergate.<br>

        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          I am a baby boomer, one of that mass of 75 million people born between 
          1946 and 1964. Damn proud of it, too, as are most boomers. As if that 
          weren't enough, I'm also a tree-hugging, granola-crunching flower child 
          of the sixties, having &quot;come of age&quot; in that lively decade. 
          I was twelve years old in 1960 when JFK became president (I handed out 
          leaflets at the polls) and 15 when he was killed in Dallas, one of the 
          worst days of my life. Like most boomers I remember November 22, 1963, 
          like it was yesterday, even more than cowering under my school desk 
          during drills for the Cuban Missile Crisis. Like a school desk was going 
          to help! </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Baby 
          boomers have been called the generation that changed the world, for 
          better, or worse. We enjoyed (and still do) our day in the sun. And 
          what a lineup-a Who's Who and What's What of people, places, and things, 
          like the Beach Boys, VW Beetles, and Woodstock. Oh, and those other 
          Beatles too. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
          boomers have been marked by the murder of our leaders. We lived through 
          the Cold War, Vietnam, and the bloody fight for civil rights, not just 
          for blacks, but also for women and gays. We initiated the struggle for 
          environmental sanity. We even survived the mania of &quot;sex, drugs, 
          and rock and roll.&quot; No wonder we're in therapy! But as the dust 
          settled in latter years, behold, a better world. Finally we could laugh 
          at Archie Bunker and Fred Sanford, and really &quot;get&quot; them at 
          the same time. </font></p>

          Two hallmarks of boomer culture are the fitness craze and adventure 
          travel. Climbing combines them both. Here Tom is training in crevasse 
          rescue prior to an ascent of Mt. Shuksan, in Washington state. </font></p>
