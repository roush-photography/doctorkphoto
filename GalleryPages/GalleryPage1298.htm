        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
          climbing expedition goes through various stages, a sort of agonal descent 
          into squalor. At the end of day one you feel grubby, but with a touch 
          of machismo (I can do this!). On the second day you are grubbier and 
          getting grumpy. By the end of day three you don't give a damn. It's 
          even beginning to seem normal. You have left the real world behind. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Appetite 
          is the same. On the first night mac and cheese never tasted so good. 
          On the second night you are starving but wish there was something to 
          eat besides mac and cheese. On the third night mac and cheese has all 
          the mouth-watering appeal of road kill, but you force it down anyway. 
          What else is there?</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Mountaineering 
          is an affliction of sorts, cause and cure unknown. At some point all 
          climbing expeditions take on remarkably similar attributes: crowded 
          tents, petty bickering, foul smelling mates, bad food, filth, fatigue, 
          headaches, altitude sickness, sundry bowel complaints (too much, not 
          enough), extreme cold, and no sanitation. Base camp is like the winter 
          of 1778, Valley Forge. Great for war stories, if you live to tell them.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Distance 
          takes on a new meaning in the mountains. A mile is considerable, two 
          inconceivable. &quot;Over there&quot; is a long way when you are on 
          foot in the mountains. Life is simple, elemental even, and time loses 
          meaning. At night you toss and turn in a vain effort to sleep. In the 
          daytime you go higher, a mindless obsession with pushing upward. But 
          there is no reason to rush because you don't seem to go anywhere anyway. 
          No matter how high you climb things look the same-rock and ice, ice 
          and rock. Where you are today is where you were yesterday and where 
          you are headed tomorrow. For all you know you are going around in circles. 
          It's all rather agreeable. </font></p>
