        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">After 
          WW 2 the nation began to realize that modern industry posed a health 
          risk to both people and wildlife. There was an evolving understanding 
          that man was a vulnerable part of the environment. In 1948 the worst 
          air pollution disaster in U.S. history took place in the steel town 
          of Donora, Pennsylvania. Intense smog caused snow to turn black and 
          clothes to shift colors. Twenty deaths and 5,000 illnesses were blamed 
          on the misty blanket of fumes and emissions that settled over the town 
          for five days. Only later would it be discovered that snow was not the 
          only thing that turned black from the smog. So did human lungs.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
          few years later the sun went out in Los Angeles. In mid afternoon drivers 
          had to switch on their lights because of smog, which caused more than 
          2,000 accidents in several hours. The citizens of LA crowded public 
          meetings wearing gas masks to protest the smog. They would soon discover, 
          to their dismay, that their own automobile emissions were the culprit. 
          The west coast megacity then began its long struggle to have emission 
          control devices installed on cars, which would take years to win over 
          protests of the industry. But win they did. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">On 
          the Missouri River, downstream from Omaha, crows were rafting on chunks 
          of grease! The locals complained of blood, hooves, hair, and manure 
          from hundreds of thousands of slaughtered animals, mingled with human 
          waste, along a stretch of river used for drinking water by two million 
          people. In 1957 the Public Health Service opened hearings on waste from 
          packing plants along the river. The outcry would finally lead to passage 
          of the first Water Pollution Act by Congress, after 60 failed attempts, 
          and over the protests of &quot;free-enterprisers.&quot; </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          1944 Congress created Big Bend National Park in Texas, and a few years 
          later the Everglades National Park, fulfilling a lifelong dream of many 
          conservationists. And in 1949 <em>A Sand County Almanac</em>, Aldo Leopold's 
          classic of nature and conservation, was published, a year after his 
          untimely death while fighting a brush fire near his home in Wisconsin. 
          And out west enraged citizens doomed plans to build Echo Park Dam, which 
          would have flooded part of Dinosaur National Monument in Colorado. </font></p>

          seals were nearly extinct in the early 1900s when they became protected 
          and preserves were set aside for breeding and calving. Numbers have 
          rebounded impressively. </font></p>
