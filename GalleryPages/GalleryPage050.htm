        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          strike out from Cusco, in Peru, across the Sacred Valley of the Inca, 
          to begin one of the world's great treks-the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu. 
          The past is present in this beautiful valley, in high noon towns like 
          Pisac and Ollantaytambo, still a long way from the modern world. Manicured 
          cornfields and carpets of blue and white wildflowers line both sides 
          of the road in this sleepy hollow. I cross the restless Urubamba River, 
          also sacred to the Inca, and drive past thatched Quechua huts and farmhouses 
          with red tile roofs. Here and there alpacas are grazing on hillsides. 
          And all around are muscular, snowcapped peaks, sentinels of this South 
          American style Yellow Brick Road.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          Inca Trail is 25 miles long and takes about five days to trek. Each 
          step is like turning a page farther back into history. The byway visits 
          several ruins of incomparable beauty and winds through some of the most 
          spectacular mountain scenery anywhere. And as if that weren't enough, 
          the gods sprinkled a blaze of colors along the way with many varieties 
          of birds and flowers.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          trail lends itself not only to wonder, but to great speculation. It 
          seems the stunning combination of natural and man-made beauty was laid 
          out by design, like a cathedral on an inconceivable scale. The purpose, 
          as with any great cathedral, was to elevate the soul of the pilgrim 
          on his spiritual quest. The Inca must have intended that those who passed 
          this way would reel in awe as they scaled the heights and descended 
          the canyons. Each crest and trough is greater than the last, building 
          to a grand climax-Machu Picchu, fabulous lost city of the Inca.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It's 
          hard to be a legend, to live up to hype. Will we be disappointed? The 
          trail from Winay Wayna clings for two hours to the girth of Machu Picchu 
          Mountain, penetrating ever deeper into the enchanted forest, to the 
          base of a final steep scree slope. At the top, hidden from view, is 
          Intipunka, the Gate Of the Sun, and gateway to the land of Oz. I take 
          a deep breath and a first step..... (next photo)</font></p>
