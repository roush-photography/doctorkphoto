          In the forest of the night. <br>
          What immortal hand or eye<br>
          Could frame thy fearful symmetry?<br>
          William Blake</em></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          contemplate the irony of my situation. I am standing in the anteroom 
          of the former hunting lodge of the Maharaja of Jaipur, now a reception 
          area of the hotel where I am staying. It is Friday morning, 4 A.M., 
          and still pitch dark outside. A small crowd is milling about the room, 
          murmuring with nervous anticipation. Casting a frozen snarl of disapproval 
          toward the entire scene is a huge stuffed Bengal tiger, mounted on a 
          pedestal. On the walls behind the beast are photographs of British royalty 
          from the Raj era, atop elephants. Sprawled on the ground in front are 
          their hunting &quot;trophies,&quot; a dead tiger for each king, queen, 
          or duke, such as the case may be. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Our 
          location is northern India, the scruffy little town of Sawai Madhopur, 
          in the state of Rajasthan. We are about to begin the &quot;trip of a 
          lifetime&quot; and embark on a tiger safari in Ranthambore National 
          Park. However, on this safari we will ride in jeeps instead of on elephants, 
          and shoot with a camera, not a gun. Our photographs, therefore, will 
          look very different from those currently on the walls. The tigers will 
          be alive! But for how long?</font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hunting 
          tigers anywhere in the world is illegal. Unfortunately, laws are seldom 
          enforced where tigers live. As a result <em>Panthera tigris </em>is 
          in serious trouble. The world's most charismatic animal faces certain 
          extinction in the wild without drastic intervention. The story is grim. 
          In 1900 there were an estimated 100,000 tigers in east Asia. Today there 
          are fewer than 3,500 hanging on in scattered reserves that have more 
          poachers than rangers. There are more pet tigers in Texas than wild 
          tigers in the world. The tiger's former range included 24 countries. 
          Today tigers are found in only 13 and some of those are questionable. 
          The Bali tiger was declared extinct in 1940, the Javan and Caspian tigers 
          in the 1970s, and most recently the Cambodian tiger in 2010. The Chinese 
          tiger has not been spotted in the wild in 25 years and is functionally 
          extinct, though about 65 remain in captivity. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          tiger's dilemma is due to habitat loss and a drastic increase in poaching 
          to supply Asia's expanding middle class with animal parts for traditional 
          medicine. Tiger penis soup to make the Chinese more virile-just what 
          the world needs! This would hardly be acceptable if the treatments were 
          effective, which they most assuredly are not. So the tiger, and other 
          endangered species, are being exterminated to placate ignorance and 
          superstition in Asia.</font></p>
