        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          am in the harbor city of Pangkalanbun, on Indonesian Borneo, ready to 
          penetrate the surrounding jungle in search of the &quot;man of the forest,&quot; 
          the elusive orangutan. My destination is Tanjung Puting National Park, 
          home of Camp Leakey, the research station of Birute Galdikas, who has 
          been living with and studying these great apes since 1971. I have prepared 
          months for this adventure and am well aware that the regime in Jakarta 
          has raped the Indonesian rain forest beyond recognition along much of 
          coastal Borneo. But certainly not where I'm going, a national park, 
          where nature is safe.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          I awaken fresh and eager to explore this wild kingdom. We board a klotuk, 
          the standard river cruiser in these parts, and set sail for the Sekonyer 
          River which will take us to Camp Leakey, two days upriver. I park myself 
          on the top deck to search for wildlife and wild humans. Hours pass and 
          I see nothing of interest, not a single bird, snake, monkey, or head 
          hunter. Only an occasional sad faced fisherman, dressed in tattered 
          western garb. They catch no fish as I putt-putt past. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">At 
          the end of the day my sightings list consists of three proboscis monkeys, 
          a solitary hornbill, and too many sad faced fishermen. And that's it 
          for an entire day in paradise. I am stunned. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          complain to my Indonesian guide who informs me that wildlife has mostly 
          fled this area after construction of a massive gold mine on the Sekonyer, 
          well past Camp Leakey. The mine employs 800 locals. Try to imagine their 
          paychecks and then try to imagine who gets the gold. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          the mining process huge quantities of mercury are dumped into the river, 
          poisoning the entire food chain, top to bottom, all the way downriver 
          to the sea. This includes people, but who cares with all that gold for 
          the taking. The only thing that really matters around here is another 
          regime in Jakarta is getting filthy rich, and closing their eyes to 
          the filthy poverty and environmental desecration in their country. The 
          Sekonyer River has become a &quot;Love Canal.&quot; I am penetrating 
          a toxic dump, not a heart of darkness. (next photo)</font></p>
