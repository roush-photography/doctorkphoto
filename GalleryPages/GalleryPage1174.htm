        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          began exploring with my family when I was very young. I grew up in south 
          Louisiana, &quot;America's wetland,&quot; a land of steamy summers and 
          astonishing biodiversity. My earliest memories are of fishing the bayous 
          and rich coastal bays and estuaries with my dad. Every weekend was spent 
          with a paddle and pole, immersed in the sights and sounds of this backwater 
          land of enchantment. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          those days I wasn't concerned with acid rain, ozone holes, or climate 
          change. Nature was not fretted over, it was a place to play and a wonderland 
          from which to learn. I knew the fields and forests at the &quot;wild 
          edge&quot; of my neighborhood, each bend in the bayou and bump in the 
          trail. I spent hours in the woods, just me and my dog. Starmy hunted 
          while I listened to birds, watched clouds sail by, and swam in the creek. 
          And I built luxurious tree houses where I could escape and dream about 
          horses and other important stuff. In my mind the world was a pretty 
          hip place, and life rolled lazily along, season after season. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">My 
          dreams came true when I was eight years old and the family moved to 
          a ranch on the outskirts of Baton Rouge. It was a magical place of field 
          and fence, barns and ponds. There were more horses than people on this 
          spread, which suited me fine. And so it came to pass that the rod and 
          reel were replaced by a new and consuming passion, for horses and all 
          that they imply. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For 
          the next ten years I lived and breathed the world of Highland Road Farms, 
          surrounded by similarly passionate family and friends. This was a different 
          world than the swamp, but nature nevertheless. Stately live oak and 
          pecan trees shaded barnyard animals and a menagerie of wild critters 
          that had plenty of room to roam in those days. Trail rides were punctuated 
          with horse shows and rodeos, blended into the perpetual summer of south 
          Louisiana, Disney's <em>Song of the South</em>, come to life. Only Uncle 
          Remus was missing. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">From 
          these early years came a reverence for the outdoors and all living things 
          that would help chart the course of my life.</font></p>
