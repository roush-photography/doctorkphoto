      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        early days of television romanticized the cowboy and the American West 
        (there were &quot;Indians&quot; around too but they were hardly romanticized). 
        I was young and very smitten with tales of Roy Rogers, Trigger, and Fury 
        on the fuzzy black and white screens of the day. I daydreamed of little 
        else but cowboys and horses. My reality was something else, however. I 
        was a city slicker, living in a crowded neighborhood surrounded by factories 
        and refineries. With people for next door neighbors and fences for kids, 
        not horses. Much to my chagrin! In those early days my only horse was 
        a dream. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And 
        that's the way it was until I was eight years old. Tired of life in the 
        city my parents purchased a farm on the outskirts of my hometown, Baton 
        Rouge, Louisiana. Things were looking up. Soon I acquired my very own 
        horse, a golden palomino, the spitten image of Trigger. I thought my heart 
        would burst. Champ was my first love, the center of my universe. Girls 
        be damned (at least for awhile). Whenever I wasn't at school I was in 
        the saddle, in pursuit of stray cows and bad guys, combing every inch 
        of wood and meadow. I was finally living the dream.</font></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        above photo is of a recent trip to Wyoming for my first experience with 
        free ranging horses of the American West. These horses are descendents 
        of domestic stock from long ago, and are thus really feral, though they 
        have lived wild and free for centuries. Many years have passed since the 
        days of my cowboy fantasies, but this was still a nostalgic journey. The 
        horse in the above photo, fourth from left, is the spitten image of Champ, 
        my first palomino.</font></p>
