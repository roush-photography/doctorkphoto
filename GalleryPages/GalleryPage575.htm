          on a mission to photograph a giant anteater so I headed to Brazil's 
          Pantanal region, rumored to still have a fair sized population of these 
          prehistoric looking beasts. Like the moose, the anteater seems to have 
          been designed by a committee that disagreed a lot. They shuffle around 
          savanna and grassland, sniffing for ants and termites with their pointed 
          probosces. When the underground morsels are detected, a couple of heaving 
          swipes at the earth with a massive forepaw puts the dagger-like tongue 
          in business. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Anteaters 
          have poor vision but a keen sense of smell. I approached cautiously, 
          to within a few feet of this beast, looking for signs of distress. There 
          were none. He obviously knew I was nearby but didn't see me as a threat. 
          He ate ants and I took pictures. Nevertheless, considering his bear-like 
          front claws, I made sure to keep safely out of reach. One swat to the 
          midsection and my guts would spill onto the pampas. Even the mighty 
          jaguar, topcat in these parts, gives the adult anteater a wide berth.
