          Unlike television nature does not steal time, it enhances it.<br>
          Richard Louv</font></em></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          notion of biophilia, proposed by the esteemed biologist E.O. Wilson 
          at Harvard, suggests that we humans experience a profound need to affiliate 
          with nature. Isolation from the natural world will lead to a diminished 
          existence. Humans require a link to diversity because that is how it 
          has always been. Millions of years of evolution within the web of life 
          has led to our dependence upon it, for our physical well-being, of course, 
          but also for the fulfillment of our emotional, spiritual, and intellectual 
          needs. The result is a more adaptable organism. When we are deprived 
          of the natural world this need cannot be replaced by television, computer 
          games, or other modern contrivances. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          full flowering of the human potential, and even our very survival, depend, 
          therefore, not only on human relationships but also upon the richness 
          of our integration with the natural world. We can no more dissociate 
          ourselves from nature than we can from society. This is clear from our 
          experience with extreme environments like prisons and concentration 
          camps, and even less extreme, such as an inner city slum. It is one 
          thing to survive the aberrant environment, and quite another to &quot;blossom&quot; 
          like an Emerson, Einstein, or Edison.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Viewed 
          in this light, then, the conservation ethic is not an outdated, romantic 
          notion of kindness, but an act of selfishness, since our very survival 
          depends upon it. The human capacity to lead a full and meaningful life 
          is only possible on a planet that is healthy and rich in natural beauty. 
          So the argument for conservation transcends the utilitarian: not just 
          clean air because pollution makes us sick; not just clean water so we 
          can drink it. We demand a healthy planet to allow soul as well as body 
          to achieve maximum health. Nature is thus a stepping-stone to a higher 
          order. </font></p>

          then is the biophilia hypothesis.</font></p>
