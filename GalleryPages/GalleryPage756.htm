        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          began exploring the world with my dad when I was very young. I grew 
          up in south Louisiana, a land of bayous and backwaters, of steamy summers, 
          and the astonishing biodiversity of coastal bays and marshes and the 
          Mississippi River estuary. It seems I saw it all, with a fishing pole 
          in hand, or on the back of a horse. In those days I wasn't concerned 
          with acid rain, ozone holes, or climate change. Nature was not something 
          I fretted over, it was a place to play and learn. I knew the fields 
          and forests at the &quot;wild edge&quot; of my neighborhood, each bend 
          in the bayou and bump in the trail. I spent hours in the woods, just 
          me and my dog, who seldom said much. Neither did I. Instead I listened 
          to birds and watched clouds sail by. I built luxurious tree houses and 
          swam in the creek. From these formative years came a reverence for the 
          outdoors and all living things that set the purpose of my life.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">My 
          vision changed when I traveled to Tennessee's Great Smoky Mountains 
          at the age of 19, my first escapade with a camera. Suddenly my world 
          was without borders, no longer just endless summers with a fishing pole 
          or riding trails. In the Smokies were great rocky peaks, chuckling streams, 
          and silent forests. No tellin' what else was out there. It all begged 
          to be explored and I was just the one to do it. I committed to travel 
          from sea to shining sea, the entire country, and capture images of her 
          wildlife and scenic wonders, just because they were there, and because 
          I loved doing it. No more, no less! (next photo)</font></p>
