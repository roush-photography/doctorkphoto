          Paul Simon</em></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Dinosaurs 
          made it to the top with sheer brawn. In contrast man has used his awesome 
          brain to populate and dominate the entire planet. His stepping stones 
          to get there included agriculture, industry, and technology, among others. 
          Since population growth is the essential measure of a species' success, 
          we are truly the modern day version of T. rex. And even T. rex did not 
          occupy every ecological niche on earth. Only man has accomplished this. 
          <br>
          <br>
          A look at this greatest of success stories is instructive, and a bit 
          overwhelming. From the emergence of modern man 100,000 years ago, to 
          the time of Buddha, Christ, and Muhammad, human population went from 
          the mythical 2 individuals to a very real 250 million. When Columbus 
          sailed to the new world, a mere 1500 years later, more than twice that 
          many walked the planet. Three hundred years then passed and the year 
          was 1776. America secured her independence from the British and human 
          population had again doubled, to one billion. About two hundred years 
          later, in 1950, human population doubled again, to 2 billion, in the 
          aftermath of World War 2. Not even the &quot;greatest of all wars&quot; 
          could slow the human juggernaut. I was born right after the war, an 
          early baby boomer, and have watched things get even worse. In the span 
          of a single lifetime human numbers have &quot;exploded&quot; to 7.5 
          billion. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          We are presently adding a China's worth of people to the planet every 
          decade. In the blink of the 20th century, .004% of human history, we 
          quadrupled our numbers in an already crowded world. What reasonable 
          person could ponder this and not be worried? And the success gets worse! 
          By the end of this century Africa, the poorest and hungriest of continents, 
          is expected to quadruple again, to 3.5 billion pathetic souls. Say a 
          prayer for Africa. Say a prayer for us all. (next photo)</font></p>
