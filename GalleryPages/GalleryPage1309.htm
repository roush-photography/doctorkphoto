        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          1973 an Arab oil embargo caused widespread shortages with increased 
          prices and very long lines at the pumps. Stations ran out of gas and 
          closed, sometimes for a day, occasionally for good. Oil was being used 
          to hold our gas-guzzling nation &quot;hostage.&quot; Americans panicked! 
          Speed limits were lowered to 55 MPH on the interstate and thermostats 
          were adjusted to conserve fuel, with President Carter showing the way 
          at the White House. For the first time there was talk in this country 
          about alternative energy sources and energy self-sufficiency.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          1974 scientists discovered that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) from spray 
          cans and refrigerators could destroy atmospheric ozone, essential to 
          filter out harmful radiation from the sun. The result was a significant 
          increase in the incidence of skin cancer. Four years later the United 
          States banned the use of CFCs. This was the beginning of an awareness 
          that many environmental problems were global rather than local. The 
          concept of globalization was born-the knowledge that actions on one 
          side of the globe can effect those living on the other. The world was 
          getting smaller and smaller. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          1953 a new school was built in Niagara Falls, NY, in an area called 
          Love Canal. A year later construction began on a neighborhood of houses 
          around the school. This in spite of prior warnings by Hooker Chemical 
          company that they had buried 21,000 tons of toxic chemical waste at 
          the site in the 1940s. No surprise when puddles of noxious ooze began 
          to seep through the neighborhood and health and reproductive issues 
          spread at alarming rates in the new residents. The Love Canal disaster 
          made world headlines in the seventies as an example of callous disregard 
          for human life. Other highly publicized legal cases following toxic 
          contamination would follow, including Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee and Anderson, 
          et al. v. Pacific Gas and Electric. These two cases were dramatized 
          in the acclaimed feature-length films <em>Silkwood </em>and <em>Erin 
          Brockovich</em>, with Meryl Streep nominated for an Oscar in the title 
          role of whistleblower Karen Silkwood, and Julia Roberts winning the 
          Oscar for her protrayal of legal clerk Erin Brockovich.</font></p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          stark contrast to hunter-gatherer societies, the modern world confers 
          a significant standard of living, health, and survival advantage to 
          our species, but at great cost to the earth. This same advantage applies 
          to only a small number (less than 1%) of our fellow species, specifically, 
          those that adapt well to a human altered environment. Examples are deer, 
          fox, and squirrel. The sandhill crane did not fare so well in the early 
          20th century as loss of habitat led to decreasing numbers. The creation 
          of wildlife refuges, like Bosque del Apache in the picture, has given 
          the species a second chance and it has responded dramatically. The mission 
          of environmental science is to find ways to mitigate man's negative 
          impact as he continues his remarkable dominion over the earth. </font></p>
