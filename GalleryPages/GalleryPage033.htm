          magnificent engineering feat, the Panama Canal is a man-made wonder 
          of the world. It was a struggle against politics, a steamy jungle, and 
          disease, not to mention the enormous engineering and construction challenges. 
          When completed in 1914 the ocean voyage between New York and San Francisco 
          was abbreviated from 13,000 to 5,000 miles. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          greatest obstacle to building the canal was disease. In addition to 
          yellow fever, the isthmus of Panama was riddled with malaria and bubonic 
          plague. An American physician, Colonel William Gorgas, who had helped 
          conquer yellow fever in Cuba after the Spanish-American War, answered 
          the call again. The task consisted primarily of clearing jungle and 
          draining swamp, where mosquitos, vectors of yellow fever and malaria, 
          bred and swarmed. It took two years during which time Gorgas also waged 
          a campaign against the rats that carried bubonic plague. Only when Colonel 
          Gorgas was done could full-scale construction on the canal begin. </font></p>
