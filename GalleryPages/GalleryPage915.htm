        not disturbed by inequality of condition: the earth and sea furnish them 
        with all things necessary. They set no value on anything we gave them.

          </em><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">When 
          Cook and his men sailed into Botany Bay they were surprised that the 
          natives didn't seem to notice. They sat indifferent on the shore or 
          fished the shallows with no change in preoccupation. Cook's vessel, 
          the creaky<em> Endeavor, </em>would certainly have been the most imposing 
          object they had ever witnessed, yet it was ignored. They saw not god, 
          devil, or doom, as did natives elsewhere. Their innocent vision would, 
          of course, turn out to be their downfall. They should have run.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">These 
          natives were very different and quickly became objects of scorn and 
          hate. The white Europeans who conquered the continent would see them 
          as filthy and feral creatures, pre-human or &quot;animal.&quot; They 
          did not have government, written language, housing, agriculture, clothes, 
          or pottery. They had no concept of ownership. Their language did not 
          include words for tomorrow or yesterday. They lived only in the now. 
          Indeed these wild creatures were different. They would have to be tamed 
          <font face="Georgia">and put to use, or be eliminated. They might impede 
          the divine march of European civilization.</font></font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">The enlightened assessment 
          of the Australian aboriginal by Captain Cook, quoted above, was indeed 
          ahead of its time. It would not, however, ease their fate. Similar to 
          other endemic peoples of the new world, they were murdered, plundered, 
          or enslaved, whatever was necessary to satisfy the immediate European 
          whim. (next photo)</font></p>
