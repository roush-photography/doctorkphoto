      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        1990s ushered in the era of President Bill Clinton, whom many historians 
        consider the most effective environmental advocate in the White House 
        since Teddy Roosevelt. And there was still much to be done as the Century 
        of Conservation drew to a close. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
        1993 flooding caused widespread damage to farms and towns throughout the 
        Midwest. The floods were aggravated by human impact on wetlands and floodplains. 
        Ecologists had seen this coming and issued warnings, but, of course, these 
        were ignored. The EPA released data in the early 90s which indicated that 
        each U.S. citizen (about 300 million of them) produced a ton of toxic 
        waste per year. This was new and startling information. And the overwhelming 
        majority of climate scientists by this time believed there was a connection 
        between human activities and recent warming trends. And yet!</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And 
        yet Americans still built expensive homes on floodplains and riverbanks. 
        They continued to generate outrageous amounts of toxic waste. And they 
        continued to saturate the atmosphere with carbon, even developing a love 
        affair with the new gas-guzzling sport-utility vehicle that persists to 
        this day.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        story in the ocean was as bad if not worse. Coral reefs all around the 
        world continued to die at an alarming rate, and what better &quot;canary&quot; 
        for the health of the ocean than this diverse habitat. In many areas as 
        much as 50% of reefs had been lost, and much of what remained was diseased. 
        The cause was global warming and pollution and the prognosis was poor. 
        The catch of commercial fisheries continued to decline, beset by overfishing 
        and pollution. The Grand Banks, off the coast of Newfoundland, once the 
        most prolific fishery in the world, were closed indefinitely to commercial 
        fishing in the mid-nineties. They remain so today, nearly 20 years after 
        the initial moratorium. In response the Canadian government initiated 
        a program to relocate fishermen and their families from Newfoundland to 
        Alberta, to work in the oil fields. Egads! Fishermen moving to Alberta. 
        Newfoundland a &quot;ghost province.&quot; The madness of it all. </font></p>
