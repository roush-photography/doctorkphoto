        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          drive into a gathering Kansas gloom, aimed in a westerly direction, 
          in search of the American West. Evening clouds are low and swift, yet 
          soft, not unfriendly yet, though they can get that way in a hurry in 
          these parts. The landscape is a sea of grass, cultivated of course, 
          as expected in the Wheat State. What I didn't expect was to find it 
          strangely beautiful. Intriguing too, knowing that somewhere out there 
          were Superman, Dorothy, and Toto, Kansans one and all. A splatter of 
          raindrops on the windshield awakens me from my reverie, and I seek refuge 
          from the weather and the night. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          next day dawns bright, chock full of sunshine and blue sky. I visit 
          several towns that all look aglow with cleanness and prosperity, quintessentially 
          American. The downtowns seem frozen in perpetual 1958. I walk the squares 
          and strangers tip their hats and smile. Cars cruise by with Buddy Holly 
          on the radio. Streets are leafy and lazy, more or less perfect, like 
          Mayberry. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Just 
          this side of Dodge City a transition takes place. Folks stop wearing 
          overalls and straw hats and don instead the cowboy hat and boots, signatures 
          of machismo in these parts. The cowboy doesn't walk, he saunters. His 
          expression is a sneer instead of a smile, as if all strangers lack manhood 
          and need to be beat up. Could it be? I believe it is-the American West. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Westerners 
          like to shoot things. When they first arrived in the West there were 
          50 million bison lumbering around, chewing on grass, like cows with 
          the bighead. Imagine what a difficult target they made as cowboys shot 
          them to shreds from point-blank range. Mostly for fun. In a few years 
          there were only about a thousand left, hiding and trembling in Yellowstone 
          Park. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Then 
          the cowboys took to shooting Indians, more of a challenge since sometimes 
          they shot back. No matter. In time their numbers would dwindle too, 
          from a couple of million to a hundred thousand. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">So 
          the government stepped in and made it illegal to shoot bison and Indians, 
          and relocated them to preserves where they were safe, at least in theory. 
          Thankfully, both have made a modest recovery without bullets being sprayed 
          in their direction. So Westerners today are left with little to shoot 
          but themselves and the occasional stray liberal. (next photo)</font></p>
