        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          polar bear is an evolutionary freak. He is white, web-footed, and loves 
          to swim. In icy waters! Go figure. But the strangest twist to the polar 
          bear story is not about color or locomotion, but rather biorhythm reversal. 
          This is well studied in a southern population that lives near Churchill, 
          Manitoba, on the shores of Hudson Bay. To master the world of the ringed 
          seal, its main prey in this part of the world, these bruins have executed 
          a biological about face. They're <em>awake in winter and mostly sleep 
          in summer. </em>How's that for bassackwards? </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">After 
          Hudson Bay freezes in November these bears, instead of going to sleep 
          like grizzlies and blacks, amble onto the ice, head south, and begin 
          to hunt for seals through the long Arctic night. They look for breathing 
          holes belonging to a male seal, then crouch and lie in wait, sometimes 
          for hours, sometimes for days. When an unsuspecting seal pokes his head 
          out to take a breath, the bear swipes and the blubbery pinniped goes 
          flying through the air like a rag doll. Voila! Polar bear bacon. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          summertime the ice is gone so seals can frolic and fish at their leisure, 
          unconcerned about bears and breathing holes. The polar bears, on the 
          other hand, mope around and amble slowly northward, half asleep and 
          full of hunger and grump. Their destination is Churchill, which they 
          reach in several months, and where they hang out and await the precious 
          freeze-up, so they can once again hunt seals.</font></p>
