          Charles Darwin</font></em></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          1944, the U.S. Coast Guard introduced 29 caribou to St. Matthew Island 
          in the remote Bering Sea, off the west coast of Alaska. The idea was 
          to provide the sailors stationed there with some recreational hunting 
          to counteract the doldrums of this godforsaken deployment. A short time 
          later the Coast Guard did the sailors one better and closed the station, 
          removing the caribou's only predator from the island. An ad hoc ecological 
          experiment ensued. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          flora of this windswept outpost consists of lichens, grasses, and dwarf 
          willow, classic tundra and a caribou feast. With abundant vegetation, 
          no predators, and no escape, conditions were ripe for a boom-bust cycle. 
          And that's just what happened. In less than two decades the caribou 
          population exploded, <em>from 29 to 6,000</em>, an unsustainable number 
          on tiny St. Matthew. Migration was impossible because caribou were everywhere. 
          Tundra became trampled and overgrazed. The once plentiful food source 
          was soon gone, the caribou out of options.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
          year later, in 1964, after a particularly brutal winter, the population 
          of caribou plummeted to just 42 individuals. In 1966, the caribou of 
          St. Matthew were gone, population zero, a boom-bust cycle of just 22 
          years.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          Like Easter Island, St. Matthew Island was a limited space with finite 
          resources from which there was no escape. In both cases lack of predation 
          led to overpopulation of the apex species with overexploitation of resources 
          and a boom-bust cycle. There is a compelling lesson here. Planet earth 
          is an island floating through space with limited resources, no means 
          of escape, and an overpopulated apex species. </font></p>
