        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Tibet 
          is described as &quot;one of the most spiritual places on earth,&quot; 
          and there is little room for argument. They pursue matters of the spirit 
          like we in the West pursue the material. To Tibetans religion is a daily 
          quest, an obsession. Most of them have little or no money and don't 
          seem to care.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Here 
          is simplicity brought to life. They eat only two meals per day, morning 
          and evening. Their fare, called <em>tsampa</em>, is a mix of roasted 
          barley and yak butter, carried in a pouch on their waist, which they 
          wash down with yak butter tea. The butter provides them a much needed 
          energy boost for life atop the &quot;the roof of the world.&quot; On 
          rare special occasions they will sacrifice a goat and roast it over 
          a fire. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          Jokhang Temple is the most holy shrine in Tibetan Buddhism, the equivalent 
          of Mecca in Islam. Pilgrims spend months to years in their travels to 
          reach this site in Lhasa's Barkhor District. Along the way they chant 
          prayers, spin prayer wheels, and even prostrate themselves, inchworming 
          along the ground, sometimes for hundreds of miles. The eeriness of this 
          spectacle is emphasized by the intentional blur in this photograph.</font></p>
