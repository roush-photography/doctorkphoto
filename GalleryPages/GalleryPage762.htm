          boomers are the biggest, best educated, and richest generation in American 
          history. We're spoiled brats, self-consumed, and we never hush. In fact, 
          we'll tell you about most anything, whether or not you want to hear 
          it. Call it boomer swagger, or whatever, it comes with our territory. 
          We were born with the silver spoon of a confident country whose economy 
          boomed right along with us. What else could it do after a quarter century 
          of Great Depression and Great War? Greatest Generation? I'll take the 
          Sixties anytime. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We're 
          also the generation determined to be, do, and have it all. We'd be zillionaires, 
          gurus, world class athletes, astronauts, or activists. Maybe even be 
          all of them. Some would come close. Just look at Steve Jobs, Hilary 
          Clinton, and Michael Jordan. Not to mention all those teenage techno 
          millionaires of the Nineties, who reaped a harvest from our generation. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Boomers 
          took over the world on August 16, 1977, the day the music (aka Elvis) 
          died. Another crisis survived. And nothing to end everything has happened 
          since. No world wars to end all wars, worst ever depressions, or eyeball 
          to eyeball nuclear encounters. Sure we've had our share of skirmishes 
          and recessions, but they seem almost tame by comparison. Things have 
          been a little happier since we hightailed it from Vietnam and watched 
          the Berlin Wall and Soviet bloc crumble. You're welcome. And China, 
          Cuba, and Vietnam seem more concerned with expanding their middle class 
          today than annihilating ours. North Korea still doesn't get it-our world 
          is better than theirs. Maybe next week. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Until 
          then we'll keep jogging, jamming, and wearing jeans. And playing with 
          our amazing toys. </font></p>
