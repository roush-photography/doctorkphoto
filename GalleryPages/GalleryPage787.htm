        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">When 
          Roger Tory Peterson published his classic, <em>A Field Guide to the 
          Birds</em>, in 1934, the nation was mired in the Great Depression, the 
          Dust Bowl, and developing conflict in Europe. In spite of these deeper 
          concerns, or maybe because of them, there was widespread interest in 
          the book and its subjects. The United States became a nation of backyard 
          birdwatchers as public concern for the plight of wildlife soared to 
          new heights.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          1940 the National Audubon Society was formed and Audubon Magazine hit 
          the newsstands for the first time. This new voice for conservation wasted 
          no time. Ornithologists were recruited to study the ivory-billed woodpecker 
          as it edged toward extinction, as well as the endangered California 
          condor and roseate spoonbill. The results of these reports were published 
          two years later and generated heated discussion. Nevertheless the woodpecker 
          never had a chance and would soon be declared officially extinct. With 
          protection the spoonbill would make a remarkable recovery while the 
          condor still hovers on the brink of extinction.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Also 
          in 1940 President Franklin Roosevelt, a cousin to Teddy and environmental 
          champion in his own right, signed the Bald Eagle Protection Act into 
          law. The national bird was considered a pest in those days and shot 
          on sight as a fish thief. When the bill was signed there were fewer 
          than 400 nesting pairs in the lower 48 states. Alaska, not yet a state 
          then, continued to pay a bounty on the eagle until statehood in 1959. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          the mid forties public attitude was shaped by the nation's involvement 
          in World War 2. Farming and ranching were vital to our war efforts and 
          the search was underway for methods to increase production. Enter long 
          acting pesticides, primarily DDT, which gained widespread use. The pesticide 
          impacted the eagle and other raptors by causing a lethal eggshell thinning. 
          This relationship would not be fully understood for decades.</font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
          rare glimpse into the world of the bald eagle, with the mother bird 
          and her very tiny chick and egg. The mother is eating a salmon brought 
          by her mate, perched nearby and guarding the nest. The chick is less 
          than one day old since the two eggs will hatch within 24 hours of each 
          other. Note the broom, bottom right, and a 2x4 plank woven into the 
          nest, giving a sense of place near human settlement, specifically on 
          a sea stack off Unalaska, one of the Aleutian Islands. This is a wonderful 
          example of storytelling with photography. The rather messy composition 
          is trumped by the powerful message.</font></p>
