          Bob Seger</font></em></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          hell this is Kathmandu, for crying out loud. Bless its polluted little 
          heart. Our final and most welcome of destinations is the gateway to 
          the Himalayas, the mightiest mountain range in the world, which we have 
          spent the last month getting to know personally. The capital of Nepal 
          is a mecca for climbers in pursuit of the world's highest summit, Mt. 
          Everest, goddess mother of the universe, at 29,028 feet. My doldrums 
          quickly vanish after the corn flakes and my first shower in a month. 
          I take to the streets with my brand new best friends.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          city is an Asian polyglot, a helter-skelter swirl of races and cultures: 
          Indian, Chinese, Tibetan, and Malay residents mix with assorted Yank 
          and Euro adventurers and hippies, as well as scalawags from most anywhere 
          else. The human chaos on the streets sweeps one past a bewildering array 
          of shops and shrines in the company of sacred cows, flea-bitten dogs, 
          and a sampling of many of God's other creatures.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Gurus 
          (photograph), spiritual guides &quot;heavy with wisdom,&quot; roam the 
          streets ready to lend a hand, always palm up. Some are genuine, most 
          are not, so it's always best to be cautious before you eat, pray, love, 
          or leave a tithe at the local ashram.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Despite 
          the congestion, pollution, and trendy commercialism (ushered in by Indiana 
          Jones, of course), Kathmandu is still a beguiling place to stroll the 
          streets and soothe one's nerves after a holiday in the Himalayas.</font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
          picture was taken in the film days. Time and converting it to a digital 
          file have taken their toll on the image. But the stories it tells remain 
          as fresh as if I had snapped it yesterday. This is the power of photography.
