          Mark Twain</font></em></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But these 
          are not trivial issues and should be looked at objectively (for instance 
          by reading a thermometer). The earth's average temperature has increased, 
          in step with rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Glaciers are 
          melting and sea levels are on the rise. Climate change is real and we 
          are the major cause. Evolution is fact, not theory. The evidence for 
          this is incontovertible. Vaccines are a good thing, and the moon rocks 
          are not fake. Being right matters, and science has a long track record 
          of getting things right in the end. Science has transported us to the 
          outer reaches of the solar system, given us push-button comfort and 
          communication, and nearly doubled our life expectancy, all in a single 
          century. Enough said! </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Nevertheless, 
          as stated, the truth is elusive. Therefore, this volume, in the words 
          of Ansel Adams, is my &quot;aggressive personal opinion&quot; based 
          on 50 years of study and exploration. It is not necessarily a page-by-page 
          presentation of facts, since only mathematics can do that. Conclusions 
          are subject to change as new information becomes available. </font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Talk about 
          elusive truth. The Mayans developed the most advanced civilization in 
          pre-Columbian America. They were noted astronomers and mathematicians 
          with the only writing system in the Americas prior to European arrival. 
          And yet their great civilization suddenly and mysteriously collapsed 
          around 1200 CE. Despite the efforts of international scientists for 
          more than 50 years, the cause(s) remains unknown. But recent data gathered 
          by NASA and Smithsonian scientists, including satellite imaging, have 
          shed new light on this mystery. These scientists assert that overpopulation 
          led to deforestation, which in turn caused climate change and drought. 
          Agricultural failure followed, with subsequent intertribal warfare and 
          eventual collapse. </font></p>
