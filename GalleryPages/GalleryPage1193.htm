        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          rules of life dictate that a species adapt to an inconstant world, or 
          else. This is true for all life, all the time. Or is it?</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Once 
          upon a time there was a crafty quadruped, a hunter-gatherer that swung 
          his way out of the African jungle and onto the savanna. Unlike the jungle, 
          his new world had few climbing trees. Our prehuman ancestor thus decided 
          to adapt and become a biped-that is, to walk around on just his hind 
          legs. A new species was born whose hands were free to do other useful 
          things. This was truly a giant step for early man. <em>Homo erectus, 
          </em>by the very act of standing erect and walking, changed the future 
          of the Earth and all its life-forms forever.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">He 
          did it initially by following all of Darwin's rules to become the supreme 
          adaptor, the best there ever was. Using his increasingly complex brain 
          and remarkable hands, with their grasping thumbs, he built shelters, 
          crafted tools and weapons, and learned to use fire for heat and cooking. 
          Thus would <em>Homo erectus</em>, and finally <em>Homo sapiens</em>, 
          become the most successful species of all time, the only one to adapt 
          to every ecological niche on the planet. An impressive resume, no doubt!

        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There 
          are very few strictly hunter-gatherer societies today. Examples are 
          the Hadza of Tanzania; the Spinifex people of the Great Victorian Desert 
          in Australia; and the Sentinelese tribe of the Andaman Islands in the 
          Indian Ocean, who are openly hostile to anything Western. The Dani of 
          New Guinea, pictured above, are more neolithic, having incorporated 
          agriculture and many modern implements into their way of life. (next
