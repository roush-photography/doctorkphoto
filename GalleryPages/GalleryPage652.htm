          They're tearing down the forests <br>
          In the jungles of Brazil<br>
          Without a second thought<br>
          To all the species that they kill<br>
          Dan Fogelberg</font></em></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Socially 
          the wild Brazilian west has mirrored, and in some cases even surpassed, 
          former frontier excesses in the U.S.. The lawlessness, greediness, and 
          raunchy night music are all there, and, as usual, tainted by booze, 
          broads, and fisticuffs. Settlers often claim their land with a gun, 
          so murder is matter-of-fact, as it was in the west of yore. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          the social ills go beyond guns and VD. There are thousands of kids and 
          not enough schools, or anything else constructive to do for that matter. 
          Imagine the mischief they can get into with all that spare time. Electricity 
          is nonexistent unless you're wealthy, and inflation of 500% means not 
          many are. Such luxuries as clean air and water, health care, and sanitation 
          seem frivolous when you're hungry and homeless. I doubt they're concerned 
          about loss of biodiversity either.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And 
          there are savages in this American West too. The indigenous peoples 
          of Amazonia are being relocated to reservations and shot if they leave. 
          And sometimes the squatters even squat the reservations. The shoot-outs 
          that follow are just as deadly and one-sided as in the heyday of cowboys 
          and Indians, the outcome just as certain.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">For conservationists, 
          Rondonia is an ecological nightmare. Over a quarter of the state is 
          clear-cut, converted to small farms and cash crop estates on land that 
          is marginal at best. After slashing and burning the jungle, they have 
          about five years before the soil is exhausted. Then there are two options: 
          they can move back east or clear another tract. And still the forests 
          fall. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia"><br>
          Indigenous peoples around the world continue to be maginalized by the 
          relentless assault of Western Civilization. Millions of acres of their 
          home, the rain forest, is being cleared every year for agriculture and 
          timber. At the present clip these forests will be gone by 2050. Gone 
          with the forests will be the greatest biodiversity on earth. </font></p>
