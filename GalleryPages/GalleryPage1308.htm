          President Jimmy Carter</font></em></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;Never 
          have a people spent so much money on so many expensive things as Americans 
          are today.&quot; With this simple but prophetic statement in the 1950s, 
          Fortune Magazine proclaimed the modern era of consumerism. Other magazines 
          (Life, Look etc) would follow suit, and advertise ad nauseum to fan 
          the &quot;material&quot; flames.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          1950s witnessed other sweeping changes to our lives as well, with booms 
          in housing and road construction. A new problem called &quot;traffic 
          congestion&quot; was making the news in our cities. It was suggested 
          that one day it might lead to traffic controls, or even &quot;stop&quot; 
          lights. The summer vacation became affordable for many Americans and 
          they sped in record numbers to our national parks. Federal agencies 
          engaged in massive reshaping of the land with dam building, wetland 
          drainage, flood control, and river dredging, which fueled the greatest 
          economic growth in world history. It seemed the more we conquered nature 
          the richer we got. A popular advertising slogan of the times was &quot;Progress 
          is our most important product.&quot; Indeed life in the USA was &quot;progress&quot; 
          in the fast lane. Boom, boom, boom.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          there was a catch to all this progress. Seems whenever we play we have 
          to pay, and in the 1950s we were playing with atomic bombs like they 
          were toys, &quot;testing&quot; (a nice word for exploding) in the Nevada 
          desert, on uninhabited South Pacific islands, and other places that 
          didn't matter much. Or so we thought. Come to find out we had riddled 
          the atmosphere with radioactive fallout that didn't vanish into thin 
          air after all. Rather it floated around the globe and settled, not just 
          over there, but here, in our own backyards. The experts seemed to have 
          overlooked this possibility. Oops. When Strontium 90 was found in cow's 
          milk, a staple in baby formulas, we began to talk test-ban treaty with 
          Russia. President Kennedy signed the treaty in 1962 and considered it 
          the high point of his presidency. That treaty is still in effect. <br>

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
          Even in wilderness areas, like the West Elk in Colorado in the photograph, 
          man's toxic impact is felt. There are over 20,000 closed mines in the 
          state, many of them leaking heavy metals (mercury, arsenic, lead, cadmium) 
          and acid into mountain streams. Such streams are often devoid of fish 
          or other life-forms. In August of 2015, less than a week after I visited 
          the area, three millions gallons of this toxic brew poured out the abandoned 
          Gold King mine and into the Animas River, which runs past Silverton 
          and Durango on its way to the Colorado River. The EPA had offered to 
          clean up the site with Superfund money but the local jurisdiction refused, 
          fearing such an effort would scare tourists away. The Animas River has 
          been responsible for 10% of the white water rafting revenue in Colorado. 
          That just might change.</font></p>
