          earth is guesstimated to be about four and a half billion years old, 
          give or take an epoch or two. It must have been a lonely and Martian 
          place for awhile, until life began to swim around in the primordial 
          ocean ooze. We now speculate this happened more than <em>three</em> 
          billion years ago, far sooner than was previously believed. God is very 
          old!</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Physical 
          and chemical forces pulverized rock to sand and then dust over eons 
          of time. In the meantime life continued to live and die and become more 
          complex. From plants evolved animals which then ate the plants and, 
          much later, each other. And since life wastes nothing, a process of 
          decay was needed to recycle all that was once alive back to earthly 
          dust. And so it was. Eventually this inorganic and organic gruel would 
          simmer into a primeval soil, and the mechanism was at hand which would 
          give rise to birds and bees, which, of course, is how we got here.</font></p>
