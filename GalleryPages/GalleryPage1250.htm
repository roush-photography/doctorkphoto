        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          morning bright as day a white beluga whale, luminous in the sapphire 
          sea, approaches my kayak. Summoned by my thrashing paddle, he swims 
          alongside the vessel. At once he tilts a bit to look my way, through 
          dark, knowing eyes, as if to check me out. Apparently concluding I am 
          friendly he begins to nibble and tug, ever so gently, on the end of 
          my paddle. A interspecies tug-of-war, no less! I am neither surprised 
          nor threatened. Belugas, like other marine mammals, have a reputation 
          for kindred spirit encounters with man. Indeed, he seems as inquisitive 
          as I.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Unlike 
          the bona fide grin of his dolphin cousin, the beluga's smile is subtle, 
          like the Mona Lisa's. There is unknowable mystery here that we are left 
          to contemplate. Add a flexible neck and you have a whale of whimsy, 
          a white ghost of blue water, agile and friendly, but elusive. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Sailors 
          of yesteryear heard beluga songs through the wooden hulls of their ships 
          and began to call them &quot;sea canaries.&quot; For whatever reason 
          the nickname stuck, probably because they are highly vocal, vying with 
          humpbacks for the title of noisiest whale. Most judges call it a tie. 
          But it's no contest in the &quot;carry a tune&quot; category, belugas 
          coming in a distant second in this field of two. A pod of belugas calls 
          to mind a junior high band audition. Sounds have been described as assorted 
          clicks, squeaks, groans, and brays, with an occasional tweet thrown 
          in. Despite the dreadful revues, the complexity of sounds suggests a 
          much nuanced inner world as the beluga confronts a wide range of experiences: 
          birth, nurturing, death, and so on-same as us. </font></p>
