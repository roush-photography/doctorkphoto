        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The near 
          extinction of 50 million bison from the American prairie in the 1800's 
          was only a prelude of the changes to come to that vast ecosystem. Man's 
          proliferation and greed exact a heavy price of nature, yet ultimately 
          we pay that price too.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          Great Plains were avoided by settlers until relatively recent times 
          because prairie soil was too root bound to plow. It was impossible to 
          turn the sod with just a horse and a moldboard plow. But the great modifier 
          would eventually have his way. The steel plow was invented and sodbusters 
          swarmed the prairie like locusts, on foot, horse, and conestoga wagon. 
          In 1849 alone, more than 100,000 crossed the central plains along the 
          Platte River corridor. Some moved on to California and Oregon, but many 
          stayed and converted the sea of native grasses to amber waves of wheat. 
          The plow was pulled first by oxen, then the internal combustion engine. 
          Meanwhile the deer and the antelope prayed, and payed the price, which 
          was near elimination from the great plains. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Changes 
          wrought by the plow helped fuel one of history's great ecological disasters, 
          acted out on the stage of America's heartland. Repeated plowing converted 
          prairie sod into fields of loose dirt, dried by drought and baked by 
          the sun: everything you need for a Dust Bowl. Fresh from victory in 
          WW 1 and riding the crest of the Roaring 20's, the rising superpower 
          abruptly collapsed, beneath a cloud of dust and the pall of depression. 
          A decade later, just when recovery seemed around the corner, Hitler 
          invaded Poland. Enough already! (next photo)</font></p>
