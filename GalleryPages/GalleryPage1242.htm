        <p align="center"><em><font size="4">The planet groans every time it registers 
          another birth.<br>
          Paul Simon</font></em></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In his 
          quest to create heaven on earth man has brought himself to the brink 
          of hell. He has swarmed the earth like locusts, trashed it, destroyed 
          much of the tropical forest, polluted every sphere, sucked rivers and 
          aquifers dry, depleted the &quot;boundless&quot; oceans, damaged half 
          the world's coral reefs, produced hundreds of thousands of weapons of 
          mass destruction, and changed the planet's thermostat. And he's not 
          done yet. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Our species 
          and planet earth are at a critical juncture. Over the next 25 years 
          human population will increase to nine billion. Perhaps a more telling 
          statistic is that three billion of those will be middle class consumers. 
          This will place unprecedented demands on the earth for food, water, 
          and energy, expected to nearly double for all three in this short time 
          frame. At some point the question must be asked-how much water, food, 
          and energy can the planet provide over the long haul? One thing is certain. 
          There is a limit.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And then 
          there are the environmental concerns. Traditionally threats to the environment 
          have been looked upon as isolated, and potentially preventable, events 
          such as war, the nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl, and BP's Deep Water 
          Horizon oil spill. These are still major concerns. But the biggest threat 
          to the environment now is generalized degradation from the necessary 
          day to day economic activities of our expanding population (agriculture, 
          industry, manufacturing, urban development etc). And these are definitely 
          not preventable. Economic growth is a good measure of our impact on 
          the earth's limited resources, and total world GDP is expected to increase 
          from $60 trillion in 2010 to nearly $100 trillion by 2020. Can we suvive 
          our own success?</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And yet 
          there seems reason for hope. Our species has a long history of coming 
          back from the brink. And advances in science and technology have given 
          us an extraordinary understanding of the dilemmas we face and what to 
          do about them. The state of our world over the next several decades 
          will largely depend on whether we have the political courage to do what 
          is necessary to apply this knowledge.</font></p>

        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Woodstock 
          community of Vermont is noted as a hamlet of the rich and famous. Middle 
          and upper classes consume a disproportionate share of the world's resources. 
          For example, the United States, with 5% of the world's population, consumes 
          40% of the world's petroleum. </font></p>
