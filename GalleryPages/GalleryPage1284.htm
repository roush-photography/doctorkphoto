        <p align="center"><font size="4"><em>I come to Australia, as many people 
          do<br>
          To see the old koala, hitch a ride on a kangaroo<br>
          John Denver</em></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">You 
          wouldn't think a place as big, as patently <em>there</em> as Australia, 
          could escape the &quot;civilized&quot; world's notice until just about 
          the modern era, but there you have it. It took Captain Cook, the greatest 
          of human navigators, to find the island continent in 1768. And what 
          he found was weirder than imagination, a place where summers are winter, 
          swans are black, and a mammal lays eggs. For real? This I've got to 
          see. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          With my guide, Sab Lord (his real name), I will visit Australia's fabled 
          Outback, land of sand, sun, kangaroos, and Uluru (Ayers Rock). Extra 
          gas and spare tires stowed, we climb aboard Sab's Land Cruiser. With 
          a grinding of gears, a couple of bucks, and a snappy but unintended 
          swipe of the windshield wipers, we are off, drawing a bead on some of 
          the hottest, dryest real estate in the world.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Sab 
          is Australian through and through, with the leathery skin, akubra hat, 
          and safari shorts to prove it-and the language, too. Beginning with 
          our introduction he says <em>mate</em>, <em>bloke, </em>and<em> sheila</em> 
          repeatedly, like a nervous tic. I assume it's for show, to give me the 
          full effect. After all I'm paying him well. Time would prove otherwise, 
          however. Every Aussie I met spoke fluent Australian. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">These 
          mates of the outback look as if they spend every day doing tough stuff 
          and every night drinking, which is pretty much what they do. They're 
          the first ones you would choose to start a colony somewhere, and for 
          whom a bit scared is the maximum allowed. Sab and company have their 
          own proud 200 year history and worldview, and no longer consider themselves 
          England's bucolic cousins. Nor are they inclined to kowtow to pushy 
          Americans.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">After 
          a morning of paved roads leading out of Darwin we finally encounter 
          reality, the washboard dirt track that will take us into wild Australia. 
          So begins nonstop axle action sufficient to rattle teeth and scatter 
          bowel gas (and any wallaby within earshot). Every hour or so we zip 
          by an oncoming vehicle with a wave, a <em>whoosh,</em> and a cloud of 
          dust. Occasionally a kanga (Aussie for kangaroo) bounces by on his way 
          to somewhere. Neatly arranged termite mounds are the dominant landscape 
          feature, like so many headstones, commemorating eons of wind, fire, 
          and flood. Welcome to the Outback. (next photo) </font></p>
