        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As if 
          James Watt wasn't enough to deal with, the decade of the eighties was 
          punctuated with truly catastrophic events. A congressional study of 
          1984 found that thousands of lakes and miles of streams in the northern 
          U.S. (as well as well as Europe and Asia) were nearly lifeless as a 
          result of acid rain. Airborne pollution from factories near and far 
          was the culprit. The same year a toxic gas leak at the Union Carbide 
          plant in Bhopal, India resulted in the worst industrial disaster in 
          history, killing 2000 and injuring 200,000 people. A few years later 
          the worst nuclear accident in history occurred at Chernobyl, in the 
          Ukraine. A half million residents were relocated and as many workers 
          were mobilized in a futile effort to contain and clean up the damage. 
          The cost in health is still being calculated and the truth will probably 
          never be known. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          first tentative evidence of human related global warming was published 
          in the mid eighties, followed shortly by further evidence of an expanding 
          ozone hole over Antarctica. True to administration form Reagan's Energy 
          Secretary Donald Hodel suggested darker sunglasses and more sunscreen 
          as a solution to the problems. When the public relations backlash settled 
          from this absurdity the administration briefly came to its senses and 
          joined with 23 other nations in a phase-out of CFCs. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">On 
          the plus side Congress reauthorized the Clean Water Act over Reagan's 
          veto and a new federal law required turtle exclusion devices (TEDs), 
          on shrimp nets. Meanwhile the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service captured 
          the remaining nine wild California condors for captive breeding in a 
          last-ditch effort to save the species. In 1988 the first condor chick 
          was born in captivity. And the American alligator was removed from the 
          endangered species list after a remarkable 20 year recovery</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">To 
          close out the contentious decade, in 1989 the supertanker Exxon Valdez 
          ran aground in Prince William Sound, Alaska. A horrified nation watched 
          helplessly as 11 million gallons of crude coated the pristine environment 
          and its wildlife, wreaking inestimable damage. One report was 50,000 
          birds dead. </font></p>
