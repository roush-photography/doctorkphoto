          A stately pleasure dome decree<br>
          Where Alph the sacred river ran<br>
          In caverns measureless to man.<br>
          Samuel Taylor Coleridge</em></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          grand scale of exploration today, best exemplified by America's race 
          to the moon with the Soviet Union, is to be compared with adventures 
          of yore. And no tale has ever been better told than the adventures of 
          Marco Polo, in his <em>Description of the World</em>, written years 
          after his return from Asia. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          year was 1271. Seventeen year old Marco departed Venice, with his father 
          and uncle, taking dead aim on the &quot;sunrising.&quot; He would not 
          return home for 24 years, at the age of 41. The threesome traveled by 
          caravan, along ancient trade routes, through Turkey, Iran, Central Asia, 
          and finally China, to reach the threshold of the great Khan empire, 
          the Taklimakan Desert. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For 
          nearly a year they struggled across the desert, riding Bactrian camels, 
          as visitors still do today. This is a windswept realm where precipitation 
          is 1/2 inch in a good year, and the parched look is relieved only by 
          an occasional clutch of scraggly poplars. Imagine our hero's excitement 
          when the &quot;pleasure dome&quot; of Xanadu, their long-sought destination, 
          appeared on yonder horizon. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">They 
          had arrived in Shangdu, aka Xanadu, the summer capital that Kubla Khan 
          had decreed in Mongolia. And well had he decreed, as Shangdu in Mongol 
          means &quot;City of 108 Temples.&quot; Coleridge's opium induced description 
          of the place was right on. The Polos were certainly humbled in the presence 
          of the Great Khan, &quot;the richest man in people and treasure there 
          ever was,&quot; ruler of an empire that stretched across China, Russia, 
          and to Iraq. But as Marco recounts, their first audience at court was 
          unmagisterial, Kubla greeting them with small pleasantries: &quot;Welcome 
          gentlemen. How was the trip?&quot; They liked him so much they hung 
          around for 17 years.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          1295 the Polos finally staggered home to Venice where they had long 
          been given up for dead. They were clad in rags and exuded offensive 
          smells as they told their tales. The tattered trio was, nevertheless, 
          embraced by all the town. They must have been given a grand reception, 
          perhaps a 13th century Venetian version of the ticker tape parade. Just 
          like the astronauts in '69!</font></p>
