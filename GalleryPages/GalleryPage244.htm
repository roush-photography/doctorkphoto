          could write a book about this photograph but will resist the urge. That's 
          for later. For the moment, suffice it to say that I was at Gombe Stream, 
          Tanzania, Jane Goodall's former home and research station, when I took 
          it. I was strolling alone at twilight, trying very hard to transport 
          my mind back to the mid sixties when she began her groundbreaking work 
          with chimpanzees at this very spot. The shy loner would come to be known 
          as National Geographic's &quot;cover girl&quot;, her face familiar worldwide, 
          like coca cola, only prettier. I was humbled by this great lady's awesome 
          spirit as I stood and gazed out over Lake Tanganyika, at the African 
          sunset. This picture captures the <font face="Georgia">mood and majesty 
          of that moment.</font></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">Today, Jane Goodall sits 
          atop a pyramid representing the world's foremost wildlife conservationists, 
          a lofty perch once held by French oceanographer Jacque Cousteau. With 
          his passing in the late nineties she took up the torch and has carried 
          it with grace, in every step she takes, speaking passionately for her 
          fellow creatures who can't speak for themselves. To walk in her footsteps 
          in Tanzania was one of the great honors of my life. </font></p>
