          the end.<br>
          Ernest Hemingway</font></em></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Keeping 
          the lid on Indonesia's intensity has never been easy. The Dutch began 
          weaving together the basic island geography 400 years ago to corner 
          the lucrative market in clove and nutmeg, at the time as valuable as 
          gold. They, of course, could not have cared less about future religious 
          or social harmony. The result was the ungainly archipelago we know today. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This swayback 
          chain of 17,000 islands, 6,000 of which are inhabited, is scattered 
          over 3,000 miles of inky blue Indian Ocean. The world's fourth most 
          populous nation (250 million) is certainly one of earth's last great 
          adventures. Just island hopping on the local airlines is a guaranteed 
          adrenaline rush. Indonesia is an unlikely mix that defies homogenization. 
          There are so many languages, religions, animals, plants, foods, clothing 
          styles, and sports that it is like trying to combine a hundred countries 
          into one. No surprise it doesn't always work. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Some of 
          the differences are not trivial, especially culture and religion. We 
          are talking about people who in some cases are as fundamentally different 
          as if they came from other planets. Many of these islands are thus very 
          unique, like tiny Bali, a bastion of Hinduism in a nation of Islam. 
          Or the Asmat region and people of Papua, whose only Western belief is 
          that they don't like the West. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The most 
          fundamental difference, of course, is religion. The world's largest 
          Muslim population (90% of the total) is being asked to coexist with 
          tens of millions of minority Christians and a hodge-podge of other faiths 
          with even smaller numbers of devotees. Interfaith conflict at times 
          seems like a way of life, threatening to rip the country farther apart. 
          And with the fall of dictator Suharto in 1998, the lid came off. Gone 
          are the steely controls (mostly military muscle) he used to stifle social 
          unrest, making way for a clashing of cultural tectonic plates. (next
