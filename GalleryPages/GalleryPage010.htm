      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hunters 
        and conservationists may seem at first like strange allies but the truth 
        is many species might not survive at all were it not for hunters shooting 
        at them. The nation's 12 million hunters are essential partners with other 
        conservation groups in wildlife management. Hunter organizations (Ducks 
        Unlimited, Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation etc) collect millions of dollars 
        per year from their members, of which 85% goes to conservation. Ducks 
        Unlimited alone has contributed $700 million since its founding in 1934 
        which has helped add five million acres of wetlands to the National Wildlife 
        Refuge system. Also, hunting and fishing licenses generate more than a 
        billion dollars per year to help state agencies acquire and improve wildlife 
        habitat in every state. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">So 
        why does hunting seem increasingly irrelevant and misunderstood in today's 
        world? No mistake about it there is a dark side to hunting, and it makes 
        headlines. There is a small subset who ignore the rules meant to insure 
        survival of game species for all. They hunt out of season, trespass on 
        private property, ignore limits, spotlight deer, bait ducks, and shoot 
        bears illegally, then sell their gall bladders to Asian markets. They 
        seem disconnected from tradition and unconcerned about their impact on 
        the game they hunt. They are obsessed with guns and killing rather than 
        sport. And the recent upswing in gun related violence, debated endlessly 
        in the media, has had a negative effect on the nation's attitude toward 
        guns in general, including those used by the &quot;good guys.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Recent 
        decades have seen a decline in the number of hunters in this country from 
        14 to 12 million, a mere 5% of the population. The niche formerly occupied 
        by hunters is being replaced by a new breed of outdoor enthusiast concerned 
        with the observation of nature, e.g. photography, bird-watching, and so 
        on. More than 30% of the U.S. adult population, or 75 million people, 
        fits into this group. Whether wildlife watchers can bankroll the outdoors 
        and the infrastructure required to tend it like hunters have in the past, 
        remains to be seen. If visitation at national parks is any indication 
        then perhaps so. </font></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Snow 
        geese assemble by the thousands on winter mornings at Bosque del Apache 
        NWR in central New Mexico. They gather in refuge corn fields where they 
        feed and rest and make a lot of raucous noise. As if on schedule, every 
        30 minutes or so huge numbers of geese suddenly take flight and circle 
        the adjacent airways. After a few moments of airborne commotion they return 
        from whence they came and settle down to continue their foraging. In the 
        surrounding areas hunters bag their limits and help to support the refuge.
