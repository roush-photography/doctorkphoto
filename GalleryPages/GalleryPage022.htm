      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For 
        a month the angels of Arctic summer have been smiling on Prudhoe Bay, 
        in Alaska. Day blends with lazy night so that it never gets truly dark 
        here, just thick twilight. At four A.M. everyone's favorite orb rises 
        in the sky like a giant yellow daisy. The thermometer will tally 50 degrees 
        this June day. On the distant tundra a herd of caribou plucks lichen and 
        fidgets, in a vain attempt to discourage the flocks of pesky mosquitos. 
        The nearby coast is clear of ice, but offshore a gallery of sculpted bergs 
        awaits the sweet warmth, to melt and shape, and melt and shape, until 
        there is no more summer ice.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
        1968 Atlantic Richfield announced the discovery of a giant oil field beneath 
        Alaska's distant North Slope tundra and Arctic Ocean. A heated &quot;development 
        verses wilderness&quot; debate immediately ensued, won handily by the 
        bulldozers. Within two years of that fateful proclamation a thousand planes 
        per day from Fairbanks and Anchorage were penetrating the former silence. 
        &quot;Overnight&quot; the boom town of Prudhoe Bay was born, 12 million 
        dollars of construction at the edge of earth, a modern day Klondike, minus 
        the bordelos. This would be followed in short order by the largest pipeline 
        project in history. </font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
        love this picture. It says so much about the world today. The Alaska pipeline 
        surges out of the ground at Prudhoe Bay, surely one of the world's most 
        forlorn spots, on the cusps of the Arctic Ocean, miles from nowhere. It 
        recedes into the distance on its controversial thousand mile journey across 
        Alaska. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">On 
        March 23, 1989 the Exxon Valdez left Valdez, AK from the Alyeska Pipline 
        Terminal at 9:12 PM. The 987 foot ship, second newest of Exxon's 20 tanker 
        fleet, was chock full of North Slope crude and bound for Long Beach. She 
        never made it. The journey was cut short when three hours later the ship 
        collided with Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound and spilled nearly 11 
        million gallons of the crude. At the time it was the 54th largest spill 
        in history. At least two points are notable here: that 11 million gallons 
        of oil poisoned one of the more pristine areas in the world and that<font face="Georgia"> 
        53 previous spills were bigger.</font></font></p></td>
