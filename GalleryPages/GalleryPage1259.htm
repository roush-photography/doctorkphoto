          Hemingway loved this panorama. So do I. And why not? The flat roof of 
          Africa explodes out of the savanna to a height of 19,341 feet. This 
          massive dome is 50 miles long, 25 miles wide, and crowned by the famous 
          Kibo massif. It the largest freestanding mountain in the world. The 
          sad transformation in our lifetime, of course, is to watch helplessly 
          as the once huge glaciers melt away like hot butter from atop this equatorial 
          wonder. Soon Hemingway's &quot;White roof of Africa&quot; will be totally 
          slate gray.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          the early 1970s I entered medical school and became friends with one 
          of my anatomy instructors. Tom was training to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro 
          while I struggled with a mountain of medical texts. I envied his passion, 
          the single-minded determination with which he pursued his quest. I vowed 
          that one day I would follow in his footsteps to Uhuru, atop Kilimanjaro, 
          the highest peak in Africa. Twenty-five years later, in September of 
          1997, that dream came true.</font></p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          savannas of East Africa stretch for hundreds of miles across Tanzania 
          from the base of Mt. Kilimanjaro (see photo). They include the Serengeti 
          Plains farther west. Both the Serengeti and Kilimanjaro are among the 
          most iconic travel destinations on earth. The savanna is born anew with 
          each dawn. The excitement is palpable. The sights, the sounds, the wildlife, 
          the people, the climbs-everything about Africa gets into your soul. 
          I will always return.</font></p>
