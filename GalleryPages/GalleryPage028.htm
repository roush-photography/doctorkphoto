      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
        Patagonia the wind is a living thing. A human obsession, like humidity 
        in the tropics. At times it's all anyone talks about. How can you not 
        talk about the wind when it chases you? And causes other strange phenomena? 
        Parked cars move. Birds flap their wings and go backwards. Trees grow 
        horizontally. Words roll off the tongue and disappear, never to be heard. 
        Cyclists? Forget it! This is the roaring forties and furious fifties-latitude 
        speaking. Welcome to Patagonia.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Never 
        precisely defined, Patagonia is as much an edge of the world state of 
        mind as a region in two countries, Chile and Argentina. Because of its 
        remoteness (way down south) and inaccessibility (regular flights only 
        recently), Patagonia has ever been a romantic and mythical concept , like 
        Xanadu and Timbuktu. To adventurers it's a magnet, a last vestige of rugged 
        wildness on planet earth. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Despite 
        the lack of a clear definition, this is a substantial piece of real estate, 
        say Texas sized. Santa Cruz Province is nearly half the region and has 
        only about 200,000 people. The rest of Patagonia is even less populated! 
        Unless you count sheep.</font></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Chile's 
        crown jewel and now a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, Torres del Paine is one 
        of the great national parks in the world. Dominated by the three great 
        towers for which the park is named, this is a destination for climbers, 
        trekkers, and the occasional photographer. They are considered the world's 
        most &quot;perfect&quot; peaks, both from the standpoint of aesthetics 
        and as challenges to great rock climbers. No world-class climber's resume 
        is complete without Cerro Torre, above, center. (next photo)</font></p>
