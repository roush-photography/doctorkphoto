        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
          are witnessing the greatest extinction crisis in the long history of 
          life on earth. The news of man's impact on natural systems seems invariably 
          bad, but there are exceptions. Here are some examples.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Few 
          wildlife success stories rival that of the wild turkey in America. In 
          the 1930's the clear-cutting of hardwood forests and hunting had reduced 
          numbers to an estimated 30,000 birds. And then states began the &quot;hacking&quot; 
          of wild turkeys and the results were immediate and lasting. Today there 
          are more turkeys being hunted than when the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth 
          Rock. They are found in every state but Alaska, including several that 
          were not part of their earlier range. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          pronghorn, distinctly North American, is the second fastest land mammal 
          on earth, after the cheetah. They once roamed in vast herds from southern 
          Canada to Mexico, and perhaps outnumbered even bison. And then along 
          came cows, plows, and unregulated hunting. The decline in numbers was 
          catastrophic, from plague populations to endangered in short order. 
          In 1915 there were only an estimated 15,000 pronghorn left on the American 
          prairie. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Recovery 
          of this big-game species has been slow but sure, thanks to the efforts 
          of multiple agencies and the introduction of enlightened sport-hunting 
          regulations. Today there are about a million pronghorn in the western 
          United States. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          the 1800's Russian fur hunters nearly exterminated Alaska's sea otters. 
          When the otter population crashed, sea urchin numbers exploded from 
          lack of predation. As a result vast expanses of kelp forests were stripped 
          bare by the herbivorous urchins. Without the forests there were fewer 
          fish and therefore fewer seals and sea lions to eat them. An entire 
          ecosystem was thrown out of balance by man's overharvesting of a single 
          species. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">With 
          20th century protection and management there has been gradual recovery 
          of sea otter populations. Animals have been relocated from the Aleutians 
          to southeast Alaska and coastal U.S. and Canada. Where otters have returned 
          so has kelp which fuels the whole system's recovery. </font></p>
