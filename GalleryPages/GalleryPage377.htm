    <td colspan="2"> <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        near extinction of 50 million bison from the American prairie in the 1800's 
        was only a prelude of the changes to come to that vast ecosystem. Man's 
        proliferation and greed extract a heavy price of nature, yet ultimately 
        we pay that price too.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        Great Plains were avoided by settlers until relatively recent times because 
        prairie sod was too dense to plow. But the great modifier would eventually 
        have his way. The steel plow was invented and sodbusters swarmed the prairie 
        like locusts, on foot, horse, and conestoga wagon. They converted the 
        sea of native grasses to amber waves of wheat. The plow was pulled first 
        by oxen, then the internal combustion engine. Meanwhile the deer and the 
        antelope prayed, and payed the price, their numbers reduced to nearly 
        none. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Changes 
        wrought by the plow helped fuel one of history's great ecological disasters, 
        acted out on the stage of America's heartland. Repeated plowing converted 
        the root bound sod of the prairie into fields of unbound dirt, dried by 
        drought and baked by the sun. Everything you need for a Dust Bowl. Fresh 
        from victory in WW 1 and riding the crest of the Roaring 20's, the world's 
        most confident nation abruptly collapsed, beneath a cloud of dust and 
        the pall of depression. A decade later, just when recovery seemed around 
        the corner, Hitler invaded Poland. Enough already!</font></p>
