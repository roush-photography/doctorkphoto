        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          morning bright as day a white beluga whale, luminous in the sapphire 
          sea, approaches my kayak. Summoned by my thrashing paddle, he swims 
          alongside the vessel. At once he tilts a bit to look my way, through 
          dark, knowing eyes, as if to check me out. Apparently concluding I am 
          friend, not foe, he begins to nibble and tug, ever so gently, on the 
          end of my paddle. A friendly tug-of-war, no less! I am neither surprised 
          nor threatened. Belugas, like other cetaceans, have a reputation for 
          kindred spirit encounters with man. Indeed, he seems as inquisitive 
          as I.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Unlike 
          the bona fide grin of his dolphin cousin, the beluga's smile is subtle, 
          like the Mona Lisa's, with the same aura of mystery. Add a flexible 
          neck to the wry smile and you have a whale of whimsy, a white ghost 
          of blue water, agile and friendly, but elusive. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Sailors 
          of yesteryear heard belugas through the wooden hulls of their ships, 
          and in what must have been a gesture of kindness began to call them 
          &quot;sea canaries.&quot; For whatever reason the nickname stuck, probably 
          because they are highly vocal, vying with humpbacks to see which species 
          can make the most noise. Most judges call it a tie. But it's no contest 
          in the &quot;carry a tune&quot; category, belugas losing hands down. 
          A pod of belugas calls to mind a youth orchestra, first practice. Sounds 
          have been described as assorted clicks, creaks, groans, and brays, with 
          an occasional chirp thrown in. Despite the woeful revues, the complexity 
          of sounds suggests a much nuanced inner world as the beluga confronts 
          a wide range of experiences-birth, nurturing, death, etc-just like us.
