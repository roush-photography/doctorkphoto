        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
          are all guilty of subjectivity, or bias, even the &quot;cold-blooded&quot; 
          scientist. It's only human. The difference is that scientific data are 
          subjected to peer review and confirmation before acceptance as &quot;truth.&quot; 
          The lay opinion, often based on an internet search of &quot;junk science,&quot; 
          is not subjected to review. We can believe what we want. So scientific 
          dogma is always wilting under the glare of intense scrutiny, a source 
          of constant criticism. Yet there is no shame in changing one's mind 
          if new data demand it. Uncertainty is inevitable on the front lines 
          of any search for truth, but science will ultimately triumph.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Recently 
          the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of the United Nations, 
          consisting of hundreds of climate scientists from around the world, 
          released a fifth report in 25 years. In it they proclaimed, more loudly 
          than ever, that global warming is a fact, and that man has contributed 
          substantially to it in the last half of the 20th century by burning 
          fossil fuels. And yet, despite many years of mounting evidence, half 
          of all Americans refuse to accept either premise. This is significantly 
          more than in other developed countries. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Much research 
          has been done in the past 25 years, most recently out of Yale University, 
          to explain why Americans are so good at &quot;burying their heads in 
          the sand.&quot; Simplistically we fall into one of two tribes. The first 
          believes that industry often behaves badly and must be regulated by 
          government. The second believes that government is the problem and should 
          stop meddling in private affairs. Whichever tribe we belong to we want 
          very badly to be accepted. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">So it 
          would seem that peer pressure does not fade with high school graduation 
          at all. It is alive and well at the club, at church, in local bars, 
          and on the golf course. To remain in the graces of our group we will 
          turn a blind eye to science if necessary, especially when it doesn't 
          appear to cause any immediate harm. So we say no to climate change because 
          the urgency is hard to grasp, the effects nebulous for the moment. And 
          we can even change our minds later if we need to.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Yet being 
          right does matter, and science will ultimately get it right. Climate 
          change is real, and so is evolution. Vaccines are a good thing and the 
          moon rocks are not fake. The evidence for all of this is overwhelming 
          and accepting it is the right thing to do. This will allow us to maintain 
          our role as the dominant species and continue to adapt to an ever changing 
          earth. This volume presents a viewpoint based on the current best scientific 
          evidence, and is always subject to change with further research. </font></p>
