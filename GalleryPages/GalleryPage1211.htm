        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For 
          a month the angels of Arctic summer have been smiling on Prudhoe Bay, 
          in Alaska. Day blends with lazy night so that it never gets truly dark 
          here, just concentrated twilight. At four A.M. everyone's favorite orb 
          rises in the sky like a giant yellow &quot;sunflower.&quot; The thermometer 
          will peak at 50 degrees this June day. On the distant tundra a herd 
          of caribou plucks lichen and fidgets, in a vain attempt to discourage 
          swarms of biting insects. The nearby coast is clear of ice, but offshore 
          a gallery of sculpted bergs awaits the sweet warmth, to melt and shape, 
          and melt and shape, until there is no more summer ice.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          1968 Atlantic Richfield announced the discovery of a giant oil reservoir 
          beneath Alaska's distant North Slope tundra and Arctic Ocean. A heated 
          &quot;development verses wilderness&quot; debate immediately ensued, 
          won handily by the bulldozers. Within two years of that fateful proclamation 
          a thousand planes per day from Fairbanks and Anchorage were penetrating 
          the former silence. &quot;Overnight&quot; the boom town of Prudhoe Bay 
          was born, 12 million dollars of construction at the edge of earth, a 
          modern-day Klondike (minus the bordelos), with an air strip, a haul 
          road, and a pipeline.</font></p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          love this picture. It says so much about the world today. The Alaska 
          pipeline surges out of the ground at Prudhoe Bay, surely one of the 
          world's most forlorn outposts, on the shore of the Arctic Ocean, miles 
          from nowhere. It recedes into the distance on its controversial thousand 
          mile journey across the pristine landscape of Alaska to the port of 
          Valdez. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">On 
          March 23, 1989 the tanker Exxon Valdez left Valdez, AK from the Alyeska 
          Pipeline Terminal at 9:12 PM. The 987 foot ship, second newest of Exxon's 
          20 tanker fleet, was filled to the brim with North Slope crude and bound 
          for Long Beach. She never made it. The journey was cut short when three 
          hours later the ship collided with Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound 
          and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of the crude. At the time it was 
          the 54th largest spill in history. At least two points are notable here: 
          that 11 million gallons of oil poisoned one of the more pristine areas 
          in the world and that<font face="Georgia"> 53 previous spills were bigger.</font></font></p>
