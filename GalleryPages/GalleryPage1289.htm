        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          am on a quest for a Komodo dragon. These antediluvian beasts are highly 
          endangered, found only on two tiny islands of the Indonesian archipelago, 
          Rinca and Komodo. Two guides accompany me, one as a bodyguard and the 
          other to watch for dragons. I am not proud and stick by the one with 
          the gun. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
          begin our journey on Komodo Island in the swelter of the equatorial 
          mid morning. For three hours we cross savanna, scramble up and over 
          craggy peaks, and finally arrive at a natural spring where deer, and 
          thus dragons, often congregate. We find a semi-shady spot in some scrub 
          on a nearby mound and take up a silent, sweaty vigil. I am fidgety with 
          anticipation. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Not 
          for long. He is huge! A Jurassic looking monster at least 12 feet long 
          and weighing over 300 pounds, slowly lumbering my way. From my not so 
          concealed perch I stare into his menacing eyes. He stops a few feet 
          away and stares back. We are eyeball to eyeball. I think about running, 
          but then think better of it. Dragons ambush deer for a living! What 
          chance would I have? I scan nearby trees for an easy climb. There are 
          none. I go for the third option and nudge the guide with the gun. He 
          awakens.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">With 
          this I relax a little, enough to comprehend my guest. He is a living 
          legend. His forked tongue flicks in and out a savage mouth, scanning 
          the world for prey. Where's a deer when you need one? He resumes his 
          reptilian crawl, passing so close that I can almost touch his pebbly 
          hide which, several sizes too large for him, hangs in horizontal folds 
          along his flanks. The only thing missing is the fiery breath. And the 
          deer. </font></p>
