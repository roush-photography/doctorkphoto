          his famous discovery at Olduvai, Leakey left Mary behind to dig in the 
          African dirt and set off on an entirely new tangent. With a twinkle 
          in his eye, a flowing white mane, and boundless good cheer, the African 
          <em>lion</em> could usually get what he wanted, from a single patron 
          or a room full of skeptics. And what he wanted most was to put flesh 
          on the bones he'd discovered. He wanted to know about the behavior of 
          man's earliest ancestors.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Leakey's 
          next sortie into the unknown, the curtain call to Olduvai, was to suggest 
          long-term field studies of primates as the best, and perhaps the only 
          way, to gain insight into early man's behavior and social life. He reasoned 
          that we should learn all we could about our closest living relatives, 
          the great apes, since behavior common to modern man and apes would likely 
          have been present 1.75 million years ago when the Olduvai fossils were 
          roaming East Africa. This project would be costly and time consuming 
          and would test all his powers of persuasion. (next photo)</font></p>
