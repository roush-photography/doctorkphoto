        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          am on a quest for a Komodo dragon. These antediluvian beasts are highly 
          endangered, found only on two tiny islands of the Indonesian archipelago, 
          Rinca and Komodo. Two guides accompany me, one to show me the way and 
          the other to protect me. I stick by the one with the rifle. I'm not 
          proud. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
          begin our journey on Komodo Island in the swelter of the equatorial 
          mid morning. For three hours we cross savanna, scramble up and over 
          craggy peaks, and finally arrive at a natural spring where deer, and 
          thus dragons, often congregate. We find a partly shady spot on a nearby 
          mound and take up a silent, sweaty vigil. I am fidgety with anticipation. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Not 
          for long. He is huge! A Jurassic looking monster at least 12 feet long 
          and weighing over 300 pounds. From my not so concealed perch I stare 
          into his menacing eyes, only yards away. He stares back. Neither of 
          us seems to know what to do next. I think about running but am not feeling 
          especially fast at the moment. I scan nearby trees for an easy climb. 
          There are none. On a positive note the guide with the gun is still around, 
          and only half asleep.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          finally relax a little, enough to comprehend my guest. He is a legend 
          come alive, slowly lumbering toward me. His pink, forked tongue flicks 
          in and out a savage mouth, scanning the world for prey. PREY? Buggers! 
          He is close enough now that I can almost touch his pebbly hide, which, 
          several sizes large for him, hangs in horizontal folds along his flanks 
          and under his powerful neck. The only thing missing is the fiery breath. 
          So far. </font></p>
