        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">You 
          wouldn't think a place as big, as patently there as Australia, could 
          escape the world's attention until just about the modern age, but there 
          you have it. The world's largest island, the only island that is a continent, 
          the only continent that is also a country, has piqued imaginations since 
          Aristotle, Pythagorus, and others first postulated a southern land mass 
          to balance the north. But it wasn't until the late 1700s that Captain 
          Cook finally found such a land, weirder than imagination! Here it was 
          summer in winter and swans were black. There was even a mammal that 
          layed eggs. Gadzooks! England was so impressed she turned the place 
          into a penal colony.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          am in the far north of the land down under, referred to as the Never 
          Never. It's an alien world of killer heat and monsoonal rains. And that's 
          just the weather. I am more interested in things that might bite me, 
          and in the Never Never that seems to be most anything. For example the 
          great white shark or giant saltwater croc. And then there are those 
          venomous snakes, 6 of the 10 most poisonous in the world. And it gets 
          worse! Drifting in the Queensland tides is the box jellyfish, that infamous 
          bubble of doom with the most lethal venom known to man. Obviously I 
          need a guide, so I give Sab Lord a call. Yes, it's his real name. </font></p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          the above photo Sab is on the left. In addition there are his assistant, 
          two aboriginal guides, and a French filmmaker documenting our adventure 
          for television. (next photo)</font></p>
