          I can say about her is all her tatoos are spelled correctly. <br>

          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Stereotypes 
          of the South date back to pre-Civil War days and are more fiction than 
          fact, as any careful look at the old Confederacy will demonstrate. But 
          myths die hard, especially if they sell. And the &quot;Old South&quot; 
          makes a good story.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Myth 
          number one is the Bible Belt. The south is widely perceived as a land 
          of decent people who don't drink, smoke, lie, or cuss. To miss church 
          is unthinkable, and sex before or outside of marriage is unforgivable. 
          The Southern baptist believes that Catholics are on a spiritual par 
          with heathens, and the two don't mix if they can possibly avoid it. 
          Teenagers (16 and over, of course) are home by ten after a Saturday 
          night date of holding hands and sipping sarsaparilla. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          reality is the south has no patent on piety, sobriety, or just plain 
          goodness. A telling statistic is that 45% of babies are born out of 
          wedlock in the south, about the same as other regions. And those who 
          wait for marriage to have children didn't necessarily wait to have sex; 
          they just got lucky or took oral contraceptives. About 10% of females 
          claim to have been virginal prior to marriage, regardless of where they 
          are from.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
          second myth is that the south is the birthplace and exclusive home of 
          the redneck culture, where they shoot first and don't ask questions. 
          The archetype drives around in a rusty pickup adorned with gun rack, 
          rebel flag decal, and &quot;God Bless America&quot; bumper sticker. 
          Movies such as <em>Deliverance</em> foster the mythology of the southern 
          redneck as a tobacco-chewing grammer school dropout who grows head lice 
          and tapeworms &quot;locally,&quot; and stalks the Cahulawassee backwoods 
          in search of human prey. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
          too is mostly fiction. In my travels around the U.S. I have found hard-drinking, 
          pistol-packin', narrow-minded bigots from Maine to California. The chief 
          distinction between the Southern variety and the others is, of course, 
          the rebel flag decal. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Lastly, 
          there is the Southern belle myth, as perpetuated by Margaret Mitchell 
          in <em>Gone With the Wind</em> and other films. This myth would have 
          us believe that a drive around the South today will pass plantations 
          with stately oaks and broad magnolias bedecked with Spanish moss. Strolling 
          the lawns will be belles in billowy dresses, twirling parasols, while 
          their silver-haired gentlemen friends sip bourbon and discuss politics 
          on the veranda. In nearby fields are descendents of former slaves still 
          picking cotton to the tune of Stephen Foster. It's all very gentrfied. 
          And very false. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          only plantations in the south today are the ones you pay admission to 
          see. And slavery, though not necessarily bigotry, was abolished long 
          ago with the Emancipation Proclamation. And shocking though it may seem 
          to some, the South does not have a lock on racial discrimination, as 
          shown by riots in Los Angeles, New York, and Detroit during the bloody 
          struggle for civil rights in the sixties. Seems people are about the 
          same everywhere, just a tad friendlier in the south. Or is that myth 
          number four?</font></p>
