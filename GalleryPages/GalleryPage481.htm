        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Ferrying 
          loads to camp three on Aconcagua, 16,000 feet. On our way to 23,ooo, 
          highest point in the western hemisphere. We hope. Six intrepid climbers. 
          We have reached the alpine zone, barren of all life but us. There is 
          no shortage of rocks, however. We are enveloped by a bumper crop, singed 
          black long ago by some underworld furnace, salted now by the occasional 
          patch of snow. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Two 
          weeks of spiraling misery, and we're only half way there. Scott says 
          we're reaching for heaven but all we find is hell. Frozen! No one argues. 
          The thermometer reads minus five degrees in the tent. Water bottles 
          are frozen solid, not much use. Seems sort of macho, but at this altitude, 
          who cares?</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Three 
          of us sit in our two person tent, pummeled by a bully wind, and stare, 
          mostly at each other, which is to say blank space. Wild of hair and 
          eyes, these are faces that would scare small children. Each climber 
          looks rather bleakly at his future. Tom pees in a spare water bottle, 
          without leaving the tent. It's too cold to go outside. Only spilled 
          a few drops. We swill warm tea, ingest our preferred pills and potions, 
          then crawl into downy sleeping bags to lie awake and rate our headaches. 
          My head thumps like a kettle drum. Paul coughs for hours, expelling 
          a shroud of gas in the process, which, trapped in the undersized tent, 
          spends the night with us. He (and consequently the rest of us) is a 
          victim of HAFE, or high altitude flatus expulsion. For real! Another 
          fitful night.</font></p>
