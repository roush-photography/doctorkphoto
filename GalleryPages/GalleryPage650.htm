        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">Borneo is not the jungle 
          of my childhood. That naive vision came from Hollywood-specifically 
          Tarzan and King Kong-as well as Kipling's <em>Jungle Book</em>, diced 
          with the imagination of 19th century European explorers. In this world 
          all things sprang from the earth in a blaze of glory. The jungle was 
          an orchard with succulent fruits and showy flowers; rowdy birds and 
          butterflies; serpents coiled around trees; monkeys swinging from vine 
          to vine; and lions and tigers lurking everywhere. The backbone of the 
          jungle was the tree, thick and emerald, festooned with epiphytes, draped 
          with lianas, and reaching for the firmament. This jungle is a myth, 
          of course. It never was, even before man arrived to age the land beyond 
          recognition.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">The mythology of Borneo 
          is also woven with tales of lost stone age tribes and fierce head hunters. 
          And while much of this was sensationalized by the overactive imagination 
          of early explorers, there is history as well as legend here. It is important 
          to understand that traditional head hunting was more than anger gone 
          amuck or a ritual of intertribal warfare. It was also a religious rite, 
          to appease the gods, much like human sacrifice by the Aztec and other 
          Mesoamerican tribes.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">Head hunting has slowly 
          declined during the 20th century thanks to peace agreements among tribes, 
          conversion of natives from their traditional animism to Islam and Christianity, 
          as well as retribution from colonial powers and modern governments. 
          However, the practice of head hunting in Borneo is deeply rooted in 
          the mists of time and so never far below the surface. (next photo)</font></p>
