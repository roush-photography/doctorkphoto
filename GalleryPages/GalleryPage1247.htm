        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And 
          this is my quest, a fluffy white ball with two black eyes. Each year 
          250,000 harp seals migrate from Greenland to bear their young on the 
          ice floes that surround the Magdalen Islands. For decades the pups were 
          hunted for their immaculate white fur to make coats for European well-to-do. 
          They were clubbed in the head and skinned, blood and brains spilled 
          in full view of terrified mother seals. Often the pups were only stunned, 
          and cried out as they were skinned alive, their cries ignored by the 
          pitiless sealers.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          the 1980's a long sought miracle happened. Led by Brian Davies and his 
          friends at the International Fund For Animal Welfare, groups of protesters 
          gathered on the ice during the March hunt. They brought with them cameras 
          and cans of green spray paint. At great risk of harm (some were), they 
          filmed the horrific slaughter and sprayed as many pups as they could 
          with the paint, rendering their fur worthless. Many pups were killed 
          anyway. Photos and videos of the hunt were circulated worldwide. An 
          angry public raised an outcry and Europe, the principle market, issued 
          a ban on the import of harp seal fur. After a long and bitter struggle 
          a cruel industry was dead.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
          decade later ecotourism groups began visiting the Maggies, toting only 
          cameras. I have joined the crowd. Our guides are the former seal hunters, 
          employed again by taking us out on the ice they know so well. Win-Win!</font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
          sad afterword! To make all of this possible visitors were taken out 
          on the ice in helicopters to see the seals. The choppers landed on the 
          thick, stable ice without concerns for many years. Unfortunately this 
          is no longer possible as climate change has created an unstable pack 
          ice. Since 2013 it has not been safe for the helicopters to land. The 
          once thriving ecotourism industry has collapsed as a result and the 
          seal hunt has resumed. The pelts are going to China these days. No surprise 
          there. Lose-lose (time to get out the spray paint again.).</font></p>
