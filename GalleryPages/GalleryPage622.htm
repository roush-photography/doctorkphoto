          widespread presence of toxic chemicals in our environment is one of 
          the grimmest discoveries of our time.<br>
          President Jimmy Carter</font></em></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Synthetic 
          chemicals have been especially problematic for life on earth since the 
          Industrial Revolution. Thousands of them have been patented, ostensibly 
          for &quot;better living through chemistry.&quot; Unfortunately that's 
          a bit of a stretch. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Some, 
          such as lead, mercury, and persistent organic pollutants (POPs or the 
          <em>Dirty Dozen</em>) are directly toxic to humans and wildlife. In 
          the U.S. pregnant women are advised not to consume fish or seafood more 
          than twice weekly due to concerns about mercury on the developing fetus. 
          And mercury levels are so high in the Great Lakes that many bordering 
          states advise anyone, pregnant or not, against eating fish caught in 
          these waters. And this is what we think we know. Traces of nearly 300 
          synthetic chemicals have been found in recent analyses of human tissue. 
          None of these had even been invented a few decades ago. And we don't 
          have a clue as yet about their toxicity.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          most widespread and worrisome effect of human activity in the last 100 
          years has been the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere from 
          the burning of fossil fuels. The consequence is global warming, now 
          established and understood. There has been a rise in global temperature 
          of 1.1 degrees in the previous century, and the most dire predictions 
          say there may be another 9 degrees of increase this century. Such a 
          future is hard to imagine and much is left to conjecture. What is certain 
          is that any species that survives will do so by making extreme and rapid 
          adaptations. It seems likely that many species will be unable to do 
          so. Without drastic changes in human behavior there will be a terrible 
          toll on the living world. </font></p>

          photo above was taken from the summit of Kilimanjaro. It shows the rapidly 
          receding Furtwangler glacier in the caldera. Beyond the Great Western 
          Breech the Serengeti Plains can be seen, stretching to the horizon. 
          As is apparent in the photo, Hemingway's &quot;White Roof of Africa&quot; 
          is now mostly slate gray. </font></p>
