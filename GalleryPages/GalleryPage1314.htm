          presents the photographer with an opportunity to practice &quot;seeing&quot; 
          the elements of graphic design: line, shape, form, texture, and pattern. 
          These elements are present throughout nature, too, if you look for them. 
          They are among the most important components of composition, most often 
          supporting the subject, as in this cityscape, though they occasionally 
          serve as primary subjects, in which case the work is considered <em>abstract</em>.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">On 
          a trip with a National Geographic group to circumnavigate the Baltic 
          Sea, we spent some time in the former Soviet republic of Latvia, my 
          favorite of the nine countries we visited. Gazing down this alley in 
          Riga, the quaint capital city, I was impressed by the number and variety 
          of geometric shapes and designs (count them-see if you can find more 
          than 10). Even the wires (lines) are important to the photo <em>graphics</em>. 
          The morning light made the buildings positively glow, while the deep 
          shadows of doors and windows gave the whole scene a rich texture. I 
          had framed the composition and was about to trip the shutter when these 
          two ladies, stepping in sync, rounded the corner. Referred to in photography 
          as &quot;the moment,&quot; this was an unexpected gift that made a good 
          picture suddenly memorable. Other examples would be a smile, a smirk, 
          a touch, or a glance. Voila!</font></p>
