    <td colspan="2"><div align="left">
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Stereotypes 
          of the south date back to pre-Civil War days and are more fiction than 
          fact, as any careful look at the old confederacy will demonstrate. But 
          myths die hard, especially if they sell. And the &quot;old south&quot; 
          makes a good story.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Myth 
          number one is the Bible Belt. The south is widely perceived as a land 
          of decent people who don't drink, smoke, lie, or cuss. To miss church 
          is unthinkable, and sex before or outside marriage is unforgivable. 
          The southern baptist believes that catholics are on a spiritual par 
          with heathens, and the two don't mix if they can possibly avoid it. 
          Teenagers are home by ten after a Saturday night date of holding hands 
          and sarsaparilla. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          reality is the south has no patent on piety, sobriety, or just goodness 
          in general. A telling statistic is that 45% of babies are born out of 
          wedlock in the south, about the same as other regions. And those who 
          wait for marriage to have children didn't necessarily wait to have sex. 
          They just got lucky or took oral contraceptives. About 10% of females 
          claim to be virginal until marriage, regardless of where in the country 
          they lie from.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
          second myth is that the south is the birthplace and exclusive home of 
          the redneck culture (using the term loosely), where they shoot first 
          and never ask questions. The redneck drives around in a pickup truck 
          adorned with a gun rack, rebel flag decal, and <em>God Bless America</em> 
          bumper sticker. Movies such as <em>Deliverance</em> foster the mythology 
          of the southerner as a toothless and incestuous grammer school dropout 
          who lives with head lice in a tapewormy town and stalks the Cahulawasee 
          backwoods in search of human prey. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
          too is mostly fiction. In my travels around the U.S. I have found hard 
          drinking, pistol packin', narrow-minded bigots from Maine to California. 
          The chief distinction between the southern variety and the others is, 
          of course, the rebel flag decal. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Lastly, 
          there is the southern belle myth, as perpetuated by Margaret Mitchell 
          in <em>Gone With the Wind</em>, and similar others. This myth would 
          have us believe that a drive around the south today will pass plantations 
          with stately oaks and broad magnolias, bedecked with Spanish moss. Strolling 
          the lawns will be belles in billowy dresses, twirling parasols, while 
          their silver-haired gentlemen friends sip bourbon and discuss politics 
          on the veranda. In nearby fields are descendents of former slaves, picking 
          cotton to the tune of Stephen Foster. It's all very gentrfied. And very 
          false. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          only plantations in the south today are the ones you pay admission to 
          see. And slavery, though not necessarily bigotry, was abolished long 
          ago with the Emancipation Proclamation. And shocking though it may seem 
          to some, the south does not have a lock on racial discrimination, as 
          shown by riots in Los Angeles, New York, and Detroit during the bloody 
          struggle for civil rights in the sixties. Seems people are about the 
          same everywhere, just a tad friendlier in the south. Or is that myth 
          number four?</font></p>
