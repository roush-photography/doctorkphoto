          Helen Keller</font></em></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">One of 
          the most remote and culturally distinct people I have visited was, ironically 
          enough, in the crowded melting pot of Indonesia. In the central highlands 
          of Sulawesi, a large floral shaped island formerly known as the Celebes, 
          are the Tana Toraja people. Isolated by the sea and hemmed in by imposing 
          mountains, the Torajans have lived for centuries in a rigidly stratified 
          caste system ruled by a small nobility. They have long resisted outside 
          influence. And though the modern world, with roads, cell phones, and 
          fast food is knocking at the door, the ancient past is still marvelously 
          alive and well there. This is most evident in their religion, a blend 
          of Christianity and ancestor worship ensconced in the world's most populous 
          Islamic nation, with hedonistic ceremonies that celebrate life, and 
          most especially death. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The supreme 
          symbol of status and wealth in Tana Toraja is the buffalo, which trumps 
          the ubiquitous scooter, the occasional car, and even the <em>tongkonan</em>, 
          their traditional boat-shaped homes. Upon the death of a nobleman as 
          many as 75 buffalo will be sacrificed at his funeral, which can last 
          weeks or months, and will be attended by all the surrounding villages. 
          The buffalo are provided by those indebted to the nobleman, so the number 
          sacrificed is roughly related to his wealth and generosity while alive. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">When the 
          feasts and celebrations are finally over and the spirit has made contact 
          with its ancestors, it is time for burial. The body will finally be 
          placed in a crypt chiseled out of a limestone cliff, another rite of 
          passage reserved only for the nobility. A carved likeness of the deceased, 
          known as a <em>tao tao</em>, or effigy, will be placed at the entrance 
          to his vault. </font></p>
