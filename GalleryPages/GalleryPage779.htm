          the redwood forests<br>
          To the Gulfstream waters<br>
          This land was made for you and me.<br>
          Woody Guthrie</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Coastal 
          redwoods, the world's tallest trees, occupy a narrow strip of California 
          coast, from Big Sur to the Oregon border.They are not to be confused 
          with the world's largest living organism, the giant sequoia tree, also 
          a redwood, which lives along the western slopes of California's Sierra 
          Nevada mountains. Woody Guthrie immortalized these trees in his fifties 
          anthem &quot;This Land Is Your Land,&quot; a rallying cry for the budding 
          eco-consciousness of the turbulent sixties. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          giant redwood is no stranger to the news and controversy. On the plus 
          side most of the remaining old trees are protected in reserves. Unfortunately 
          this represents only three percent of their former glory. We are left 
          with twigs, a lot of second growth, and a few memorial giants standing 
          aloof like living rockets. Conservation of redwoods today often comes 
          down to individual trees and a few scraggly patches. More good news, 
          however. The villain in this story, Pacific Lumber Company, is belly 
          up after decades of clear cutting and battling tree huggers. Finally, 
          the bad guy comes in last. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          the struggle is never done, not as long as there are profits to be made. 
          In spite of the old growth reserves, and even with the closing of most 
          sawmills since the '08 economic bust, the emblematic wildlife species 
          of the redwood forests-spotted owls, marbled murrelets, and coho salmon-are 
          in steady decline. There is even poaching of trees and burls, just like 
          in the third world. Where's the protection?</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Yet 
          there is reason for hope in redwood country. For the first time since 
          the battle began a century ago there is more growth of redwood than 
          is being cut. This may be a true turning point. Rumor even has it the 
          elusive cougar is making a comeback in these woods. There is talk of 
          a new forestry ethic in which the forest is managed to provide not only 
          jobs and lumber, but wildlife habitat and clean rivers as well. And 
          a new purpose has risen with the new millennium. Turns out redwood forests 
          are the best at sequestering carbon to fight climate change. Thus landowners 
          are being paid to let the trees live and grow. So one day there may 
          be sweeping views of giant trees again. </font></p>
