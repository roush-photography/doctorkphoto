          sounds and the first buffalo is sacrificed to symbolize the moment of 
          Du'nang's true death and the release of his spirit to begin the ascent 
          to heaven. Soon a second buffalo is killed to assure the spirit will 
          make contact with its ancestors. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Then young 
          women in brightly colored traditional garb, and adorned with dazzling 
          jewelry, enter the plaza square and begin the funereal dance. Moving 
          gracefully to their own inner rhythms, they disregard the rapid beat 
          of the drums. The dirges they sing are soft, almost under the breath, 
          adding to the solemnity of the moment. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">When the 
          dance is over the men, in stark contrast, lunge into the plaza center 
          with frenzied chanting. They tote wailing pigs destined for sacrifice. 
          Soon the entire plaza is filled with the clamor of men and pigs. Then 
          the procession moves to the sacrificial arena where there are louder 
          pig protests, followed by the preparation of peppers, pork, and blood, 
          a Toraja delicacy, which is then roasted in bamboo vessels over wood 
          fires. Much is consumed on the spot but there is plenty to cart home 
          for future sustenance. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Over the 
          next several days hundreds of pigs and 32 buffalo are sacrificed, a 
          testimony of Du'nang's esteem in his village. The meat is distributed 
          to the guests and relatives using a complex system of rules based on 
          rank and obligation. During the days or weeks of ceremony the body of 
          Du'nang will continue to lie in state in his home, awaiting the proper 
          time for burial of the flesh. At that time he will be placed in a crypt 
          chiseled out of a limestone cliff, another rite of passage reserved 
          only for the nobility. A tao tao, or carved likeness of the deceased, 
          will be placed at the entrance to his vault. </font></p>
