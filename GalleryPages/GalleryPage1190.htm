        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">So Martha 
          and her kind belonged to the ages. A victim of man and his unconscionable 
          greed? Perhaps. It's hard to say otherwise, knowing the facts. But as 
          we shall see, humankind at its worst can change. There is more to this 
          story.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">We've heard it before. 
          During the 1800s the American bison was nearly exterminated by hired 
          guns. I choose my words carefully as this was not hunting with a &quot;fair 
          chase&quot; or a noble purpose, but mass killing for profit and fun. 
          After skinning, the remainder of the carcass was left to rot on the 
          prairie (though occasionally the tongue was eaten). In this manner a 
          thundering herd of 50 million bison was thought to have been extinguished 
          by the late 1800s. And then, lo and behold, a small herd, less than 
          a thousand, was discovered in Yellowstone National Park. Could it be-a 
          reprieve?</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">A century ago thousands 
          of grizzlies prowled the Pacific Northwest. But like the bison they 
          were persecuted, victims of an extermination program by men who wanted 
          to rid their world of danger. So they shot the bears and built cars, 
          highways, and nuclear power plants. There are no grizzlies in this region 
          today. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">Less well known was a 
          drama unfolding in the southeast coastal wetlands of the U.S. The snowy 
          egret was suffering a fate similar to the others, being shot to smithereens 
          by plume hunters at point blank range. The reason? To provide feathers, 
          and even stuffed carcasses, to the fashion industry to make huge hats 
          for the well-to-do in New York, Chicago, and elsewhere.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">The indiscriminate killing 
          of bison, bear, pigeon, and egret would eventually generate a strong 
          backlash of public opinion. As the nineteenth century drew to a close, 
          the shoot-em-up mentality of &quot;hunters&quot; in America was being 
          seriously challenged. A conservation ethic was emerging in the nation, 
          championed by powerful new forces. The &quot;big stick&quot; of President 
          Teddy Roosevelt would establish the National Wildlife Refuge system 
          and set aside 230 million acres of wild lands for protection. And a 
          fledgling organization, destined to become the <em>National Audubon 
          Society, </em>would serve as a strong advocate for wildlife. (next photo)</font></p>
