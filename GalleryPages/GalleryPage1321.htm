        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">One 
          of the major flaws in all economic systems is that the earth's resources 
          are treated only as capital-assets to be turned into profit. Trees, 
          wildlife, soil, minerals, and water are just commodities, or economic 
          goods, their price the cost of extracting and turning them into something 
          that will sell. More importantly, economic systems assume, in defiance 
          of all logic, that the earth's resources are inexhaustible, and that 
          economic growth can continue forever. And since economics also asserts 
          that the most rational action for an individual is to vigorously pursue 
          his immediate self-interest, the future is ignored.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But nature 
          does more for us than just provide lumber, steel, bush meat, and so 
          forth for human needs. Natural ecosystems maintain the very life support 
          systems of our planet. Yet those of us in the developed world seldom 
          give these services much thought. So our clean air and water, soil formation, 
          oxygen balance, pollination, and all the rest are taken for granted 
          as we single-mindedly pursue the almighty dollar like good free market 
          soldiers. This is a serious mistake. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1997 
          a team of 13 scientists and economists collaborated on a first-ever 
          study to place a dollar value on the services ecosystems perform for 
          us (and all life, for that matter). They identified 17 major goods and 
          services we depend on and calculated a dollar value for each. The total 
          value came to $41 trillion, considered a conservative estimate. To put 
          this value in perspective, the total world GDP in 2010 was $60 trillion. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">From a 
          different perspective, we are talking about the aggregate value of life 
          on earth, surely beyond dollars and cents . Given the essential nature 
          of ecosystems, we, as the only stewards of our planet, must assure their 
          health and survival. Only in this manner can we too survive.</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Land, 
          sea, and sky. The dramatic western coast of Ireland, the Emerald Isle, 
          is one of my favorites of the many countries I have visited. During 
          three weeks of exploring, I fell spectacularly and permanently in love 
          with the place. But there is trouble in paradise (beyond the constant 
          interfaith haggling). Centuries ago, 80 percent of Ireland was covered 
          by native forests. <font face="Georgia">Because of unsustainable logging 
          after the arrival of Europeans, that number is now less than 1 percent, 
          making Ireland the most deforested of all European nations. In the meantime 
          the island nation's fisheries are suffering the same fate, as stocks 
          have critically declined due to overfishing. And neither have the skies 
          been spared. There are far fewer breeding birds here than in nearby 
          countries because of habitat degradation. Thus, while many species have 
          been recorded, the majority are rare or migratory, and spring is mostly 
          silent.</font></font></p>
