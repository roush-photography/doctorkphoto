        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Man's 
          inhumanity to man is well documented, but what about to other life forms? 
          Do we just beat up on each other or are we less selective? It would 
          seem that our insensitivity, fueled by greed, ignorance, and ego, knows 
          no bounds.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The largest 
          species ever to occupy this planet is the blue whale, twice as big as 
          the biggest dinosaur, bigger even than the General Sherman giant sequoia 
          in California. In the early 1900's whalers, operating out of Grytviken 
          station on the wild island outpost of South Georgia, butchered 25,000 
          baleen whales in less than 50 years, many of them blues. In the process 
          they killed a speciman that was 110 feet long and weighed 200,000 pounds! 
          <em>The largest living creature ever to live</em>! For blubber to light 
          the street lamps of London. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Abraham 
          walked the earth when certain bristlecone pines first thrust their tender 
          roots into the two mile high gravelly soil of the White Mountains in 
          California. These oldest pines are living ruins, fittingly stunted and 
          gnarled to look the part. Windblown ice and sand have scoured the wood 
          smooth and beautiful, as if worked by the hand of god. The oldest known 
          tree is Methuselah, 4800 years, making it the oldest living thing on 
          earth. But it wasn't always so. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Once upon 
          a time there was Prometheus, a bristlecone pine tree killed shortly 
          after discovery in 1964. It seems there was a geologist in search of 
          information about Ice Age glaciers, and was willing to do anything to 
          get it. He was taking core samples from the bristlecone pines of California 
          when he found a tree he knew to be at least 4,000 years old. As he sampled 
          it, his coring tool broke. Rather than wait for another tool the man 
          asked for and received permision from the U.S. Forest Service to cut 
          the tree down. To kill it in minutes with a chain saw! Prometheus proved 
          to be 4,950 years, <em>the oldest known organism to ever live on earth</em>, 
          300 years old when the pyramids were built in Egypt. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Neither 
          the scientist nor the Forest Service ever expressed remorse at this 
          outrageous act. The public, however, did, and the identity of the Methuselah 
          tree is thus kept secret to prevent a fate similar to Prometheus. </font></p>
