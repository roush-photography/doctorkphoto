        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">After 
          the mail drop the remainder of the flight to Kaktovik is anticlimactic. 
          It is mid-September, autumn in the far north. The sky is thick with 
          cloud cover which by now is spitting snow on this remote village of 
          200 Inuit. The locals are hunkering down for another long winter, which 
          is how they spend about 75 percent of their lives. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Each 
          September an enduring ritual is played out on this half-frozen stage. 
          Traditional whaling crews go out in open boats on a hunt that is sacred 
          to their culture. They will attempt to fill subsistence quotas established 
          by the U.S. or Canadian governments. For the village of Kaktovik the 
          quota is three bowhead (also known as &quot;right&quot;) whales. The 
          meat and blubber give the people protein and fat they need to survive 
          another Arctic winter. And the hunt strengthens ties to the past and 
          bonds within the Inuit community. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          hunt does something else. It has given rise to a fledgling tourist industry 
          on this godforsaken island. After a whale is butchered the remainder 
          of the carcass is dozed onto a lonely spit of land fittingly called 
          the boneyard. Nearly a hundred polar bears are attracted to the area 
          to scavenge this bonanza. In turn, about a hundred visitors assemble 
          to view and photograph the bears, and to soak up the minus five star 
          luxury of the Waldo Arms, Kaktovik's only hotel. Not exactly Disney, 
          but it's a beginning. </font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          local guide drives his motorboat onto the snowy banks of Barter Island 
          so five photographers can sit awhile and &quot;shoot&quot; the crowd 
          of polar bears gathered in the distance, about 30 or 40 of them. One 
          of the bears begins a slow and ponderous march toward the boat from 
          about 300 yards away. Hundreds of photos are taken as the bear approaches. 
          Finally he is close enough that the photographers stop taking pictures 
          and start fidgeting. The guide says nothing, then looks away and takes 
          a long drag on his cigarette. Finally, just as the bear is about to 
          climb aboard, he nonchalantly reaches for the key, starts the engine, 
          and puts it in reverse. As noted in the photograph, the bear is disappointed. 
          We are neither disappointed or amused. </font></p>
