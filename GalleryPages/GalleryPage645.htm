        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Flying 
          into Siem Reap, Cambodia, Southeast Asia's greatest lake, Tonle Sap, 
          comes into view in the distance. Its shores are lined by a clutter of 
          Khmer homes, built on skinny stilts as protection from flooding during 
          the monsoons. The lakeshore could be a scene out of most any third world 
          country. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Angkor, 
          on the other hand, is something special. Visible as a jigsaw of brownish 
          blotches on the forest canopy of northern Cambodia, the vast temple 
          complex witnessed one of history's great vanishing acts. The Khmer Kingdom 
          spanned roughly the Middle Ages and, at its zenith, dominated much of 
          Southeast Asia. Angkor was the capital city of Khmer, and with nearly 
          a million people, the largest urban complex of Eurasia prior to the 
          Industrial Revolution. And yet in the late 1500's, when Europeans stumbled 
          upon the floral shaped towers of Angkor Wat, the Khmer's crown jewel, 
          the civilization was in agonal decline.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Theories 
          abound as to the cause of this demise, but recent excavations indicate 
          that extremes of weather may have been the root cause. A series of megadroughts 
          interspersed with periods of monster monsoons overwhelmed the world's 
          most sophisticated hydraulic system since the aqueducts of Rome. This 
          led to failure of the rice crop and widespread starvation. With political 
          and religious unrest already destabilizing the kingdom, the food shortages 
          became a final straw. Khmer never had a chance.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          Khmer civilization was not the first felled by climate chaos. Evidence 
          suggests that the great Mayan Empire of Mesoamerica collapsed 500 years 
          earlier from overpopulation and food shortages, aggravated by a series 
          of droughts. The eery similarities between the fate of these two mighty 
          Middle Age empires is not lost on climate scientists today as they struggle 
          to predict the effects of global warming over the next century. </font></p>
