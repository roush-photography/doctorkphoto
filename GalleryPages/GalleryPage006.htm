      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There 
        are some who believe that species diversity should be preserved, not just 
        because it is valuable to us, but simply &quot;because.&quot; Such people 
        believe that each species is a creation of god and a product of millions 
        of years of evolution, and should be respected if for no other reason. 
        They argue that we are of the earth and must take care of our home (after 
        all, if we can't live here, where will we go?). And too, they say that 
        it is selfish to exploit the entire planet without regard for the future. 
        Instead, we should be &quot;good stewards of the earth&quot; and consume 
        modestly, for the sake of the next generation. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        typical person with an eco consciousness is an urban dweller of the first 
        world, educated, and at least middle class. Basic needs are easily met 
        so there is much time for recreational thinking. Such people are very 
        much in a minority worldwide though they often have considerable voice 
        and political clout. Many others genuinely lament humanity's pillaging 
        of the planet but simply don't have the time to give it more than a passing 
        thought as they get through their days filled with more pressing issues. 
        Critically, the vast majority of persons on the planet do not have the 
        luxury of even caring. For most of them just getting enough to eat is 
        a daily struggle.</font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        largest of the world's macaw species, the hyacinth macaw is truly one 
        of nature's most beautiful creatures. Increasingly endangered from habitat 
        loss and the pet trade, efforts are being made to restore wild populations 
        of this magnificant bird. The Hyacinth Macaw Project of Brazil has met 
        with some success, supported by tourist dollars. Ecotourism encourages 
        the conservation of species around the world. If it doesn't do so with 
        minimum impact, it is not ecotourism. </font></p>
