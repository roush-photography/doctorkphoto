        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          problem confronting the monarch butterfly is clear, the destruction 
          of habitat in the eastern U.S., particularly the corn belt. This irresistible 
          insect depends on one plant species for its larval phase to survive, 
          and that is milkweed. It's the only food source the caterpillar can 
          eat. Without milkweed there will be no monarchs, and it just might happen 
          unless something changes in a hurry. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">According 
          to experts at the Monarch Joint Venture, a consortium of 26 groups committed 
          to saving the butterfly, the midwestern United States, cradle of most 
          monarch butterflies in the northern hemisphere, has lost 60% of its 
          milkweed in the last decade. This loss is responsible for most of the 
          population collapse of the monarch butterfly throughout the hemisphere. 
          A lethal combination of factors has led to this dilemma. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Without 
          a doubt the single biggest factor has been the development of corn and 
          soybeans genetically engineered to be resistant to the herbicide glyphosate, 
          or Roundup, in the late 90s. At about the same time the Energy Independence 
          and Security Act, from Washington, mandated a massive increase in ethanol 
          production as part of our nation's push toward energy self-sufficiency. 
          So planting corn suddenly was not only profitable, it was patriotic!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          response, and in short order, there was massive conversion of former 
          grasslands, rangelands, and conservation reserves to corn fields, of 
          the GMO variety. And further, million of acres of &quot;edges,&quot; 
          along roadsides and agricultural fields, once left to native plants, 
          were also plowed and planted with corn. And then the coup de grace-this 
          Indiana sized patchwork of former butterfly heaven, about 24 million 
          acres of it, was saturated with Roundup. A true monoculture resulted. 
          Gone were native plants, including milkweed, and the butterflies and 
          other pollinators that depend on them. Only the crops survive! </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">While 
          solutions to controversial issues such as herbicides, GMOs, and ethanol 
          mandates are debated in Congress, the experts say there is no time to 
          waste. A grass roots effort is being initiated by government and private 
          groups to save the monarch. Americans are being called upon to plant 
          milkweed and restore native plants in their backyards. The only solution 
          to this crisis will be the largest habitat restoration effort in history. 
          We cannot wait for government to act. For information on how you can

        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
          picture was taken 25 years ago, in the days of Kodacolor negative film, 
          and shows its age to the scanner. Nevertheless it tells a powerful story. 
          It was taken at a roadside intersection near my home. Sadly this photo 
          probably could not be taken today. Huge swaths of pollinator habitat 
          are now being removed each year by the mowing and spraying of roadsides, 
          which is expensive and accomplishes little. By halting this single practice 
          we could restore millions of acres of native plants to the environment 
          and help fuel the return of pollinators, including our favorite insect.
