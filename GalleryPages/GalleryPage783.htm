        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Seems 
          the older I get the less angry I am. Some of my &quot;Sixties&quot; 
          attitude has definitely mellowed. I now consider myself a realist bordering 
          on optimism. Not Pollyanna, mind you, but maybe some day. I am more 
          able to see environmental progress now than in the past. I still read 
          and write about the problems I perceive in the world, caused by greedy 
          people who inflict harm on our planet for personal gain. But we must 
          recognize and promote our victories as well. You can't motivate people 
          to change if they see nothing wrong (Pollyanna), or if they see nothing 
          right (pessimism). </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Consider 
          the <em>The Population Bomb</em> scare of the 1970's. A best seller 
          by Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich, the book forecasts a planet soon 
          to be bloated with people, absent of biodiversity, and rife with war, 
          poverty, and famine, Easter Island on a planetary scale. This bleak 
          prophecy had distinguished proponents and abundant data to back it up. 
          Thus the wide audience. And yet in 2010 the prognosis for planet earth 
          looks considerably more hopeful. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          recent decades the population of virtually all developed countries has 
          leveled off or is declining. The reasons behind this happy turn of events 
          are many, complex, and not entirely understood. And some demographers 
          now predict that third world countries will follow suit by the end of 
          this century and stabilize world population at about 9 billion. If so 
          this would be the best news of our lifetime. There would still be an 
          additional 2 0r 3 billion people to stress the world's space and resources, 
          but this is far fewer than earlier predicted. Consumption by wealthier 
          nations, primarily the U.S., will still need to be adjusted to deal 
          with the increase, but this is an inevitable outgrowth of inhabiting 
          a finite planet. It's just a question of now or later.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It should 
          be noted that this is a best case scenario. Other scientists and demographers 
          predict a human population of 15 billion before growth stabilizes, probably 
          by this century's end. This would present a reality much closer to the 
          earlier &quot;population bomb&quot; forecasts, meaning Ehrlich was right 
          but his timing was off. So perhaps a &quot;cautious optimism&quot; is 
          in order. </font></p>

        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia">The surge flow of Medano Creek, in Great 
          Sand Dunes NP, is endlessly fascinating to visitors and occurs at only 
          one other place in the world where the necessary conditions are met. 
          The water surges into the creek bed in waves (shown above), for several 
          minutes, then sinks beneath the sand. The cycle repeats itself on average 
          about every minute. As dependable as Old Faithful. (next photo)</font></p>
