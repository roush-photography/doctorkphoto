        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          Grand Canyon of the Colorado River is something very special, an &quot;awesome 
          statement, even for nature to make,&quot; as John Muir said. The entire 
          region is wierd and wonderful. Nowhere else is there this sweet combination 
          of uplifted sedimentary rock in a desert environment, exposed to carving 
          by a raging river for millions of years. The result is an alien landscape 
          of form and color played upon by light.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Vault 
          of the heavens! A picture framed by sky! And all the other inadequate 
          words that fill tomes. Despite the best efforts of poets, painters, 
          philosophers, photographers, presidents, and normal folks, the Grand 
          Canyon defies representation. It must be experienced with heart and 
          senses, and even then the canyon remains aloof from mere mortals, sharing 
          her deep secrets only with the angels. And so we return (14 times for 
          me), ever in search of the canyon soul, beyond worldly grasp.</font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
          bit of trick photography? Perhaps. This picture was taken in the gorgeous 
          slot of Antelope Canyon (see previous picture), where every day a shaft 
          of light beams down as the sun arches over at midday. With normal exposure 
          the subject is awash in unflattering harsh light. However, with one 
          simple tweak of a camera setting, called spot metering, the angel is 
          rendered in perfect light, as the canyon walls go dark. Such is the 
          phenomenon of dynamic range. </font></p>
