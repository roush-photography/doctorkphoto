        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          Sixties refers not only to a decade but to this country's last great 
          social revolution. It was a time when the younger generation began to 
          question the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War, and in fact, 
          any war. The rallying cry of those turbulent times was &quot;Make love, 
          not war!&quot; Students traded in their swords for pot and flower power. 
          They had Elvis, the Beatles, and birth control pills, and were willing 
          to burn their draft cards, go to prison rather than Vietnam, or even 
          defect to Canada. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
          revolutionary period is credited with spawning an environmental movement, 
          with emphasis on the word &quot;movement.&quot; Environmentalism had 
          been around in this country since the early 1900's, but primarily as 
          small numbers of &quot;ivory tower&quot; intellectuals. It was fairly 
          easy for middle America to ignore them as eccentric and insignificant. 
          Meaningful environmental laws were a hard sell, but that was about to 
          change. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">After 
          <em>Silent Spring</em> in 1962, the decade became a mixture of hard 
          lessons and political wrangling. <em>The Wild Kingdom</em>, a television 
          show with Marlin Perkins of the St. Louis Zoo, came into our homes every 
          week. Millions dropped what they were doing and tuned in, enthralled 
          at the spectacle of Africa. The first part of what would become the 
          Clean Air Act passed Congress in 1963. There would be other acts to 
          follow. Babies were booming and the wild was rapidly diasppearing, so 
          in 1964 a National Wilderness Preservation System set aside millions 
          of acres &quot;where the earth and its communities of life are untrammeled.&quot; 
          And two years later it got really radical when the Endangered Species 
          Preservation Act (a precursor of the sweeping act of 1973) gave animals 
          a right to exist for their own sake. Suddenly we weren't stewards but 
          cohabitants. And just as suddenly environmentalism was no longer underground, 
          it was front page news and pop culture. The environmental movement of 
          the sixties was born. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          all was not smiles in the Garden. A tragic reminder that there was much 
          more to do came in 1969 in the form of a catastrophic oil spill off 
          the coast of Santa Barbara, California. Even the &quot;high rent district&quot; 
          wasn't safe from contamination. It would take years for the physical 
          wounds to mend. The psychological scars remain today. Just a few months 
          later a burning slick of kerosene and oil floated down the Cuyahoga 
          River, <em>through the city of Cleveland</em>! A television ad pictured 
          the travesty with Native Americans weeping in the foreground.</font></p>
