          George Schaller-&quot;The Serengeti Lion&quot;</em></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          one of the great ironies of modern history, the Deep Water Horizon drilling 
          platform in the Gulf of Mexico was blown to bits on April 20, 2010, 
          and then sank two days later, on Earth Day. It was the 40th anniversary 
          of this national celebration of the earth! Eleven workers died and 17 
          were injured as British Petroleum's 560 million dollar platform joined 
          the ranks of the infamous and sank one mile to the bottom of the Gulf. 
          So did the dreams of thousands of coastal workers in oil, tourism, and 
          fishing. What followed was nothing short of an environmental holocaust, 
          televised into our living rooms nightly for what seemed an eternity.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">An 
          Exxon Valdez-worth of oil spewed out of the sea floor <em>every four 
          days for nearly four months</em>. A total of five million barrels. The 
          consequences? A oil slick the size of Oklahoma floating atop the Gulf, 
          along with a submerged plume 60 miles long and a mile wide and deep 
          drifting with the currents. Two thousand miles of beaches, bays, and 
          barrier islands stained. An immeasurable toll on wildlife and coral 
          reefs, much of it already threatened or endangered. And this is what 
          we know.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">All 
          in all the U.S. can now claim two of the worst man-made environmental 
          disasters of all time (wartime excluded)-the dust bowl and Deep Water 
          Horizon. To be fair, the Dust Bowl was only partially man's fault. The 
          drought was an act of God. Or was it?</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          most shocking subplot in this entire debacle was the revelation of BP's 
          oil spill response plan. It would be hilarious if such things were funny, 
          which, of course, they are not. Bottom line, the multibillion-dollar 
          corporation had no plan for a spill in the Gulf. The one submitted talked 
          about protecting walruses, sea otters, and other wildlife found only 
          in the Arctic and other distant seas! It listed a marine biologist as 
          an emergency responder who had been dead for years. It failed to mention 
          anything about currents, prevailing winds, or other oceanographic conditions 
          in the Gulf which might be important in case of a spill. And the list 
          goes on. Yet BP claimed its plan could handle a spill of 250,000 barrels 
          a day, twice the size of the actual spill, which it obviously could 
          not handle. </font></p>
