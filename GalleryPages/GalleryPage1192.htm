          us with gratitude rather than contempt,<br>
          we must leave them a glimpse of the world as it was in the beginning.<br>
          President Lyndon Johnson-signing the Wilderness Act of 1964</font></em></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">The environmental movement 
          of the 1960s in this country was a response to a long history of overexploitation 
          of species, environmental degradation, and sometimes outright calamity. 
          These in turn sparked scientific study, grass roots action, and legislation. 
          Increased awareness of issues resulted from the powerful new medium 
          of television, as well as the visual arts and literature. Nearly 50 
          years of this awareness spawned a brand new science (environmental science), 
          a new vocabulary, and even revised school curricula. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">In 1962 Rachel Carson 
          warned us that &quot;we are silencing songs we've never heard.&quot; 
          <em>Silent Spring</em>, her bestseller and winner of the National Book 
          Award, presented the scenario of a world without birdsong if pollution 
          and the use of DDT continued. President Kennedy read the book and charged 
          his Science Advisory Committee to study the &quot;pesticide problem&quot; 
          and make recommendations. The link between DDT and plummeting bird populations 
          was firmly established, and the pesticide was banned in the U.S. and 
          most other developed countries in the early seventies. Carson, the shy 
          and unassuming scientist, would be credited with starting a revolution-the 
          modern environmental movement-still going strong 50 years later. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">This was a grass roots 
          revolution in which a newly militant citizenry demanded the curtailment 
          of pollution, the cleanup of polluted environments, and the protection 
          of pristine areas. Established organizations were joined by new ones 
          such as the Sierra Club and the Nature Conservancy, among many others. 
          In response to the pressure Congress created the Environmental Protection 
          Agency and passed numerous laws protecting the environment and wildlife, 
          such as the Clean Air Act of 1970, the Clean Water Act of 1972, and 
          the Endangered Species Act of 1973. A disastrous hazardous waste problem 
          at Love Canal, in New York, led to the Superfund Act of 1980. Scientific 
          studies on acid rain, the thinning of atmospheric ozone, and climate 
          change would lead to further grass roots activity and policy changes.

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">The Wilderness Act of 
          1964 set aside millions of acres &quot;where the earth and its communities 
          are untrammeled.&quot; Most of these areas are in the western states 
          and Alaska. </font></p>
