        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
          Americans don't like to confront the really tough issues of poverty 
          and hunger. We turn a blind eye or chalk it up to laziness so we can 
          get on with our mostly materialistic lives. The majority of us live 
          better than royalty of bygone days, consuming a lavish diet and enjoying 
          luxury, health, and longevity unimagined a few years ago. To make ourselves 
          feel better we do an occasional &quot;mission&quot; trip to Africa and 
          offer assistance, sugar-coated with salvation. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">To 
          gain a different perspective I spend a great deal of time in really 
          poor countries, where most people still live in shantytowns, in the 
          filth of their own sewer, struggling from day to day. And I've learned 
          a thing or two about work. I mean really hard, backbreaking work, in 
          fields and factories, dawn to dusk, male and female. And children! Six 
          to seven days a week. For little or nothing but the chance to survive. 
          And these are the lucky ones who have a job. Most don't. Those who survive 
          do so on bland diets that are mostly rice or some other grain. They 
          suffer from chronic protein deficiency in countries where education 
          and health care are for the rich only, all 1% of them. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">If 
          this isn't depressing enough, consider that according to recent news 
          reports, in spite of hunger and poverty, agriculture provides enough 
          energy to fuel population explosions in virtually all of the third world. 
          This malignant growth of human numbers represents the single greatest 
          threat to all life forms on this planet outside of nuclear war. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And, 
          in an ironic turnaround, the population of many developed countries 
          has finally stabilized. Japan and Italy are even worried about population 
          declines. Too many here. Too few there. Bad news everywhere! It's enough 
          to make you want to shoot the television.</font></p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Patrick 
          Joseph Kennedy left County Wexford, Ireland, in 1858, during the great 
          potato famine. He settled in Boston and carved out a niche for his family. 
          Two generations later his grandson, Joseph P., would become one of the 
          richest men in America. His son, John F. Kennedy, became president of 
          the U.S. in 1960. Rags to riches stories are commonplace in this nation. 
          Unlike some, the Kennedys never forgot their roots or their poverty.</font></p>
