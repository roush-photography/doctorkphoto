          is clear that on environmental issues Ronald Reagan rode against the 
          American mainstream for eight years. The 'great communicator' was unable 
          to persuade Congress to repeal a single important environmental law. 
          He is the only president this century who served his term without proposing 
          any major initiative to further the cause of conservation.&quot; This 
          powerful quote by Stewart Udall speaks volumes about the environmental 
          backlash of the eighties, engineered by Ronald Reagan and his reactionary 
          Secretary of the Interior James Watt. Surely Mr. Watt ranks as one of 
          the most self-serving and low-minded cabinet appointees in history. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          Secretary would take the reins of office and lead a charge to increase 
          logging, drilling, and mining on public lands. This was shortly after 
          pronouncing to the nation that environmentalism was a &quot;left-wing 
          cult,&quot; perhaps his most famous quote, and his swan song. Mr. Watt 
          would resign in disgrace after half a term. Good riddance Mr. Secretary, 
          and to you Mr. President, for appointing him! </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Despite 
          the attempted roadblocks of Reagan conservatives the eighties was an 
          active decade for conservation. And it all began at the beginning, in 
          1980, during the waning days of the Carter administration. After ten 
          years of a well-orchestrated campaign by many leading conservation groups 
          Congress passed the Alaska National Interest Lands Act. In a stroke 
          of the Carter pen more than 100 million acres were added to federal 
          parks, forests, wilderness areas, and wildlife refuges. In one of the 
          more ironic twists to this nation's story, the most sweeping conservation 
          measure in all of history helped to &quot;inaugurate&quot; the antienvironment 
          presidency of Ronald Reagan. (next photo)</font></p>
