      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
        love birds but am no &quot;birder,&quot; as I am most often clueless about 
        the identity of species I photograph. The only birds I know for sure are 
        the common ones. You know them too, the redbird, bluebird, blackbird, 
        fried chicken, and such. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
        gorgeous bird posed still as stone for about ten minutes at Ding Darling 
        National Wildlife Refuge, on Sanibel Island of Florida. I approached very 
        slowly from afar, to within about three feet, pausing often and snapping 
        photos each time I did, in case the bird took flight. It never moved a 
        muscle, twitched an eye, or flicked a feather, not even when this &quot;giant&quot; 
        kneeled by its side. I wondered if he was sick. Or fake! I became more 
        intrigued by the situation than the photographic possibilities. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">After 
        several minutes the answer appeared. The object of it's undivided attention 
        became suddenly apparent when he stiffened, then stabbed the sand with 
        his rapier-like beak and emerged with this crab for a snack. The crab 
        was tossed around a couple of times, then swallowed whole. The yellow-crowned 
        night heron would repeat this performance twice over several minutes, 
        never once winking, smiling, or in any other fashion acknowledging my 
        presence. I felt rather snubbed but nevertheless got this fabulous photo 
        to show for it. And yes, I did have to consult my guidebook to make the 
        identification. </font></p>

        known as a winter birding hotspot, populations at Ding Darling have been
