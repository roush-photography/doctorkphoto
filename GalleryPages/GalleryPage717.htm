        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
          humans generally avoid the desert unless we happen to be one of that 
          strange breed called the &quot;desert rat.&quot; Since the 1960's the 
          Sonoran Desert, of southern Arizona, has experienced an infestation 
          of this vermin. Refugees from the north are retiring in swarms to an 
          irrigated, climate-controlled desert, of &quot;perpetual sunshine, 72 
          degrees, and golf,&quot; smack dab out of the brochure. There seems 
          no limit to the human homing instinct. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          Sonoran is as desert as they come, totally useless, utterly worthless, 
          and, to some, the most beautiful place on earth. With summer heat approaching 
          200 degrees at ground level and rainfall comparable to any respectable 
          desert, she spreads herself more or less equally between the U.S. and 
          Mexico. You can find her in California, Arizona, and the Mexican state 
          of Sonora, 100,000 square miles of cactus badlands. But this is not 
          a desert of endless dunes or salt flats. This is a <em>living</em> desert, 
          with giant saguaros, and boomtowns like Phoenix and Hermosillo. And 
          as any desert should be, the Sonoran is rife with things that can stick, 
          sting, bite, or burn. Like the cactus, scorpion, rattlesnake, and sunshine. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">With 
          &quot;rainy seasons&quot; (a few inches) in both winter and summer the 
          Sonoran is the most botanically diverse desert in the world, with more 
          than 2,000 species. And without a doubt the star of this stellar cast 
          is the giant saguaro cactus, found only in this desert. The enduring 
          symbol of southern Arizona, it can grow to a height of 60 feet, weigh 
          tons, and live for centuries, truly a plant of superlatives. Not only 
          that, a saguaro's graceful stature and artistic arms make it seem almost 
          human, even friendly, and definitely photogenic. Indians believe the 
          saguaro is a human in another form, and with their perpetual &quot;stick 
          'em up&quot; silhouette, it's hard to argue. (next photograph)</font></p>
