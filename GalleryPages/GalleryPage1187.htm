          We shall not cease from exploration<br>
          and at the end of all our exploring<br>
          will be to arrive where we started<br>
          and know the place for the first time<br>
          T.S. Eliot</em></font><font size="4"><em></em></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Why 
          explore? The question that's been asked since time immemorial. My favorite 
          answer is to quote the heralded British climber, George Mallory, when 
          asked by a flippant reporter in the U.S. why he wanted to climb Mt. 
          Everest. His retort: &quot;Because it is there!&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          Earth is pretty well trod, basic geography known. Only a few blank spots 
          remain on the map, mostly in Antarctica, the Congo, and the Amazon Basin. 
          So is man done exploring? Hardly. Not as long as he has that unquenchable 
          desire to know. There's always the ocean floor, the moon, Mars, and 
          maybe one day the galaxies.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Exploration 
          has historically been a search for booty to plunder-gold, spices, ivory. 
          Even today there is talk of natural resources on Mars and of modifying 
          its atmosphere so we can exploit them. Gadzooks! How will we get them 
          here? Build a bridge? At least there are no martians to exterminate 
          with our diseases. Or so we think. A far cry from the &quot;Age of Exploration,&quot; 
          1500 to 1900 CE, when perhaps 75 percent of indigenous populations in 
          the Americas were wiped out by European germs. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Is 
          man more enlightened today? A definite maybe. We certainly like to think 
          so. A recent climbing expedition to Antarctica, sponsored by National 
          Geographic, required climbers to carry out all waste, and I do mean 
          all, including human excrement. A step forward to be sure. And explorers 
          today often become great advocates for the people, wildlife, and wild 
          places they explore. Think Jane Goodall, Sir Edmond Hillary, and Jacques 
          Cousteau. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          same fundamental questions always seem to crop up. Is what we discover 
          there for us to exploit or simply to admire and preserve? Perhaps some 
          balance is in order.</font></p>

          Pukapuka was one of two landfalls made by Magellan, one of the great 
          explorers of all time, in his yearlong (and the first ever) crossing 
          of the Pacific in 1521. Today the tiny island is home to about 50 Polynesians, 
          including the princess in the picture. The nearest inhabited island 
          is hundreds of miles away.</font></p>
