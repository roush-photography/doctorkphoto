        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          this is not a local or regional problem. Oceans everywhere are a shell 
          of the past. From the top of Greenland to the abyssal bottom of Antarctica 
          we are seining our seas empty of fish. During the last 50 years populations 
          of most commercially important species have declined by at least 50 
          %. Fifty percent of everything we eat from the sea is now farmed, adding 
          insult to an already injured ocean. And there's little relief in sight. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">To 
          list a few of the problems: 1)A hi-tech armada vacuums up shrimp wherever 
          they are found; 2)Pristine reefs off Indonesia are poisoned by cyanide 
          and blasted by dynamite to supply colorful hors d'oeuvres to China's 
          burgeoning middle class; 3)The Grand Banks of Newfoundland, once the 
          world's most prolific fishery, are now barren. Fished that way by massive 
          factory trawlers that destroyed spawning grounds in the process. So 
          there's little hope of recovery any time soon, if ever. There's been 
          no fishing for 20 years. 4)The giant bluefin tuna, king of the deep, 
          prince of Japanese sushi, is in trouble, as world fisheries collapse; 
          5)And then there are the longlines, whose miles and miles of baited 
          hooks drown sea turtles and birds, and billions of pounds of &quot;bycatch,&quot; 
          a catchy word for unwanted fish, killed and tossed overboard as garbage. 
          Greedy and ignorant seem a harsh indictment of the once noble fishing 
          profession, but what else is there in light of the facts?</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Is 
          this dismal picture inevitable in a world bloated with hungry people? 
          Perhaps not. There are well managed fisheries in Alaska, Iceland, and 
          most notably in New Zealand. This progressive little nation did the 
          obvious to restore their overfished coasts. They set aside huge areas 
          as reserves. No fishing! And wonder of wonders, their waters surged 
          back to life. </font></p>
