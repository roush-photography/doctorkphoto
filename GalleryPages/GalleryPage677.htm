        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Photography 
          has been called every man's art form. The power of photography to influence 
          opinion has been understood for a long time, dating back to before the 
          Civil War. And the opportunity to snap an enduring image is available 
          to most anyone today, those with hi-tech cameras, or &quot;just&quot; 
          a cell phone.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
          ability to influence has never been more apparent than during the Vietnam 
          War. Three images from that war were emblazoned in the consciousness 
          of the world in the 1960's and 70's, and helped bring the controversial 
          conflict to a slow and agonizing halt. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          1963 the catholic regime of President Diem was repressive to Vietnam's 
          buddhists, who comprised a majority of the country's population. In 
          protest, Quang Duc, a buddhist monk, drove his Austin from the Imperial 
          City of Hue to a busy intersection in Saigon. He then got out the vehicle 
          and assumed the lotus position in the heavy traffic. A fellow monk doused 
          him with gasoline, whereupon Duc struck a match to himself. His burning 
          image was flashed around the world. In response, President Kennedy withdrew 
          support for Diem, who was then assassinated as his government toppled.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Tension 
          mounted as the surprise Tet Offensive began in 1968. Saigon's police 
          chief Ngoc Loan was on alert to keep Viet Cong guerrillas out of the 
          city. Loan executed Van Lam, a prisoner, in front of An Quang Pagoda 
          as photographer Eddie Adams snapped a Pulitzer Prize winning photo. 
          This image helped to turn the tide of public opinion against the war, 
          not just in the United States, but around the world. Loan claimed Van 
          Lam had killed Americans and Vietnamese while others argued that he 
          was just a foot soldier, following orders, who did not deserve to be 
          executed. In spite of worldwide protests the war would drag on for seven 
          more endless years. (next photograph)</font></p>
