        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Han 
          Chinese, descendents of the dragon, are increasing in number and affluence. 
          They are, therefore, a force to be reckoned with on many levels. They 
          may bring about the end of world wildlife as we know it. This statement 
          is not farfetched. The decimation of tiger, rhino, and elephant populations 
          from poaching is all too real. This is mostly due to demand from Asian 
          markets for traditional medicines and highly prized ivory carvings. 
          The Chinese are not the only offenders, but they are the biggest. And 
          these are not the only species in harm's way.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Bears 
          have been hunted since time immemorial for their gallbladders, used 
          in traditional Eastern medicine, again mostly in China. When wild populations 
          were decimated, bear farming began. Thousands of bears are now kept 
          their entire lives in cramped cages and milked twice a day for their 
          bile with indwelling gallbladder catheters. This atrocity has not stopped 
          the hunting for the few wild bears that remain. That won't stop until 
          there are NO bears. <em>And bear bile has no proven medicinal value!</em></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Millions 
          of seahorses are harvested from the wild each year, hung out to dry, 
          then sold in China as treatment for whatever ails their expanding middle 
          class. The preposterous claims for cures have no basis in medical science. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">An 
          estimated 150 million sharks are slaughtered each year to make fin soup 
          in China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. No surprise, wild shark populations 
          are plummeting. They are caught and their dorsal fins excised. The shark 
          is then tossed back into the sea, unable to swim, to die a slow death 
          from starvation. The nutritional value of shark fin is zilch and the 
          soup's flavor comes from seasoning.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And 
          the list of endangered species grows longer!</font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
          harmless black tipped reef shark is pictured above. Shark attacks are 
          extremely rare and sensationalized by television, movies, and media. 
          As humans increase in number it is impossible for the earth to crack, 
          the wind to blow, or a shark to hunt without encountering a person close 
          by, who then gets hurt. And guess who's around to tell everyone about 
          it?</font></p>
