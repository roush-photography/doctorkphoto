          the morning goes by and nothing to show for it. A park ranger finally 
          stops by to see what the problem is. After all we haven't moved for 
          hours. Very rare on safari. Doug explains to the ranger that we plan 
          to capture cheetah mating rituals on film, something seldom done. The 
          bemused looking ranger then, in the most pleasantly polite manner typical 
          of Africans, explains to Doug that we have been observing two brothers<em> 
          </em>all this time, and cheetahs aren't really known for alternative 
          lifestyles. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          guide mystique fades fast as we laugh and Doug sulks. &quot;An honest 
          mistake,&quot; says he. Then a surprise. One of the cheetahs suddenly 
          bolts after and takes down a full grown wildebeest. Thirty yards from 
          the jeep! It is over in seconds and only one of the &quot;highly skilled&quot; 
          photographers in our group raises a camera in time to capture the takedown. 
          You guessed it-Doug. Thus my good friend has the last laugh after all.<br>

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Cheetahs 
          have lightweight bones necessary for the high-speed chase of fast-moving 
          prey, usually antelope and gazelle. They seldom tackle prey as heavy 
          and formidable as a wildebeest. The risk of bone injury is too great. 
          The very pregnant uterus in the picture explains why an exception was 
          made in this case. Pregnancy equals vulnerability.</font></p>
