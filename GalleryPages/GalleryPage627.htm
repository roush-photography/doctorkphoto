        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          Asia does not have monopoly on the cruel and unsustainable exploitation 
          of wild animals. Europe and the United States provide huge markets for 
          the pet industry. None of this trade is necessary. It serves one purpose-to 
          provide status symbols to those who need them and who otherwise don't 
          know or don't care about the harm done. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Exactly 
          what are we talking about here? Tens of millions of fish and invertebrates 
          and thousands of tons of coral per annum to supply aquaria in the U.S. 
          and Europe. None of this stock can be farmed or raised in captivity 
          to sell. It has to be harvested from the world's shallow reef systems, 
          the &quot;rain forests&quot; of the seas. To add injury on top of injury 
          there is massive waste, with a 50-90% mortality during harvest and transport!</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Coral 
          reefs around the world are being plundered and poisoned at a clip faster 
          than tropical rain forests. Out of sight, out of mind seems to apply 
          here. There is less publicity and concern for the reefs than the rain 
          forests. Some of the facts are shocking. Unscrupulous traders dynamite 
          or release sodium cyanide onto millions of coral heads each year. Believe 
          it or not. Stunned and dead fish alike float to the surface where the 
          live ones are easily plucked from the water. No matter that these practices 
          are indiscriminate, with huge overkill. Or that they destroy reefs, 
          for, let's say, a thousand years. The attitude is, &quot;It's not my 
          problem.&quot;</font></p>
