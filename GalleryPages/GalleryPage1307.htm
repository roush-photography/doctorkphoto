        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">South 
          Georgia Island is a wild and romantic place, not dissimilar to the Galapagos 
          Islands or Ngorongoro Crater, Africa's Eden. All are small in area, 
          with abundant and fearless wildlife. South Georgia is a 100 mile-long 
          wilderness oasis in a world mostly out of sync with nature. This outpost 
          lies &quot;south of where most ships sail,&quot; at latitude 54 degrees, 
          a thousand miles from Cape Horn or Elephant Island, take your pick. 
          This explains why there has never been a permanent human settlement 
          here, only lonely whalers and members of the British Antarctic Survey.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          typical island fantasy is a place of warm sun, white sand, bare skin, 
          and gentle surf. Add lovers strolling on the beach and you have a picture 
          postcard. But not of South Georgia. Over half of this island is capped 
          by permanent snow and ice, with 150 glaciers spitting bergs and bits 
          into a frigid sea. The island is as jagged as a dragon's spine, with 
          more than 300 peaks rising like steep ramparts from the sea and jutting 
          through the mantle of ice, into a sky that's usually dark and brooding. 
          The surrounding ocean is also littered with giant tabular (table like) 
          icebergs, each one a work of art calved from Antarctica's ice shelves. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Most 
          of these peaks have not been named much less climbed, though a few have 
          been graced by the footsteps of Ernest Shackleton during his heroic 
          trek of 1916.</font></p>
