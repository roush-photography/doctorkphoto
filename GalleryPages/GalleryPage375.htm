        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Eighteen 
          summers had come and gone in my life, all more or less the same. Horses, 
          heat, and humidity in the deep south. My golden palomino and I galloped 
          across galaxies, tamed the wild west, and rescued damsels in distress. 
          I thought the world was a pretty hip place as a kid, and life rolled 
          lazily along, season after season, like a fairy tale.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          the summer of '67, my nineteenth, was something else, the end of innocence 
          and a new beginning, as I would realize only years later. Months earlier 
          I had changed my major at LSU from engineering to pre-med. As long as 
          I could remember I had planned to be an engineer, like my father. The 
          switch was dramatic, even careless. I had no clue what was happening. 
          At the same time my lifelong passion for horses was fading into a fond 
          memory. I felt like Jackie Paper, bidding farewell to his magic dragon 
          in that &quot;sixties&quot; coming of age ballad. So as the seasons 
          turned 19, I began to ask questions. The answers came hard. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Reeling 
          from all the confusion, I left home in June, alone, on an odyssey to 
          places I'd never been before. In the Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee 
          I wandered the hills in search of answers. And one day, amid all the 
          confusion, in that sea of rocky tops, I gained the high ground, hoisted 
          a camera for the very first time and snapped a photograph. And from 
          that moment on things would be different. In the summer of '67, a physician-photographer 
          was born.</font></p>
