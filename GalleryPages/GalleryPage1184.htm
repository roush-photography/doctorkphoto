        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For 
          a century and a half photography has opened our eyes wider to the beauty 
          and wonder of the world. It has permitted us to see things we could 
          not before the frozen image, for example, a horse suspended in midair 
          at full gallop. Photography has expanded the concept of aesthetics by 
          teaching us that there is beauty in most everything. Items once considered 
          mundane and not worth the artist's effort have been elevated to art 
          with a camera: a dew drop, an autumn leaf, a single blossom illuminated 
          by a godbeam. We can capture different viewpoints, from the microscope 
          to the telescope, and even the satellite, and archive them for posterity. 
          What a thrill it must have been for the old photographers to contemplate 
          going beyond the paintbrush and actually freezing the real thing, creating 
          a permanent record of people and the world. It must have seemed a miracle 
          back then. How far we've come, yet it still does.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Given 
          its widespread application, it is hard to overstate the influence of 
          photography on modern life, from selling widgets to stopping wars. Few 
          would argue with a suggestion that the camera is more powerful than 
          the paintbrush or musical note, especially when one considers that television 
          and movies are merely moving pictures.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Just 
          as important, photography has become a valued part of most lives, not 
          just the artistic few. Surveys show that 95 percent of homes in the 
          U.S. have cameras or smartphones used to take pictures. Thus each of 
          us can preserve memories to revisit privately, to share with family 
          and friends, or to post on a website and make a statement. And how do 
          you put a price on laughter, love, or personal satisfaction?</font></p>
