        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          one of the great ironies of modern history, the Deep Water Horizon drilling 
          platform in the Gulf of Mexico was blown to smithereens on April 20, 
          2010, and then sank two days later, on Earth Day. It was the 40th anniversary, 
          to the day! Eleven workers died and 17 were injured as British Petroleum's 
          560 million dollar platform joined the ranks of the infamous and sank 
          one mile to the bottom of the Gulf. So did the dreams of thousands of 
          coastal workers in oil, tourism, and fishing. What followed was nothing 
          short of an environmental holocaust.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">An 
          Exxon Valdez worth of oil spewed out of the sea floor <em>every four 
          days for nearly four months</em>. A total of five million barrels. The 
          consequences? A surface area of ocean the size of Oklahoma blanketed 
          with oil. A submerged plume 60 miles long and a mile wide drifting with 
          the currents (Lord only knows what will happen to this monster). Two 
          thousand miles of beaches, bays, and marshes stained. An immeasurable 
          toll on wildlife and coral reefs, much of it already threatened or endangered. 
          And this is what we know.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">All 
          in all the U.S. can now claim two of the worst man-made environmental 
          disasters of all time (wartime excluded)-the dust bowl and Deep Water 
          Horizon. To be fair, the Dust Bowl was only partially man's fault. The 
          drought was an act of God. Or so we think..</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          most shocking subplot in this entire debacle was the revelation of BP's 
          oil spill response plan. It would be hysterical if such things were 
          funny, which, of course, they are not. Bottom line, they didn't have 
          a plan for the Gulf. The one submitted talked about protecting walruses, 
          sea otters, and other wildlife found only in the Arctic and other distant 
          seas! It listed a marine biologist who had been dead for years as an 
          emergency responder. It failed to mention anything about currents, prevailing 
          winds, or other oceanographic or meteorological conditions in the Gulf 
          which might be important in case of a spill. The plan also lists a Japanese 
          entertainment website as a primary equipment provider. Yet BP claimed 
          its plan could handle a spill of 250,000 barrels a day, twice the size 
          of the actual spill, which it obviously could NOT handle. (next photo)</font></p>
