        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Demographers 
          generally agree that the <em>demographic transition</em>, when populations 
          stop growing and merely replace their numbers, will have spread around 
          the world by mid-century. That's a good thing. On the other hand, best 
          case scenario, the earth will then be bloated with about nine billion 
          people. This is not so good. Just how bad it will be is on a lot of 
          people's minds. It's also very hard to say. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Will the 
          world be a hellish place then? Some would say so. It's hard not to worry 
          given the facts. And some parts are already hellish. There are 21 megacities 
          in the world with a population of more than 10 million, with poor nations 
          expected to add many more by mid-century. Delhi's numbers swell each 
          year with migrants who arrive to find things just like where they came 
          from-insufficient water, food, and habitation. Dhaka in Bangladesh and 
          Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have grown exponentially 
          since 1950, by a factor of 40! Their slums are filled with the suffering, 
          who also fled abject poverty in the countryside only to be disappointed 
          in the city. A better life can be hard to come by. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Nations 
          can face the same pressures as cities. Bangladesh, one of the most densely 
          populated countries in the world, is also one slated to suffer most 
          from the ill effects of climate change. Rising sea levels will displace 
          tens of millions. Where will they go? And things in Rwanda may be worse. 
          It can be argued that the genocidal massacre of a million or so Rwandans 
          in 1994 was caused by more than Hutu hatred. Overpopulation was the 
          root cause. There were simply too many farmers dividing their land into 
          increasingly small fractions that no longer fed families. Hunger and 
          crowding make us do desperate things. </font></p>
