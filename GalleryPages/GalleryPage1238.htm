        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          assumed that when I crossed the border from Kansas to Colorado that 
          the Front Range would just be there, in all its majesty, waiting for 
          me. Wrong. Eastern Colorado was a mirror image of western Kansas, flat 
          and dusty. Desperate townships and hardscrabble farms pockmarked the 
          highway and were verily unattractive, like pimples. Dogs ran in packs, 
          urinating on scrubby trees and rusty gas pumps. Old men played checkers 
          on town squares, and chewed and spit. Beer cans and broken bottles sparkled 
          among the roadside stubble. Every road sign had been shot dead several 
          times. And still I search for the Coor's commercial? </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Two 
          hours later, at some nameless crossroads, I veered left on Highway 24 
          and found it. The sun was bright, the sky cobalt blue, and an armada 
          of clouds skimmed the horizon to announce the awesome presence of the 
          Rocky Mountains in the distance. The more I drove the bigger they loomed. 
          I was filled with happiness. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          road eventually led up and over Wilkerson Pass. On the down side a most 
          agreeable valley appeared with flowered fields, glistening streams, 
          and log cabins pressed against muscular mountains. It was heaven and, 
          best of all, I had it almost to myself. As I approached the town of 
          Buena Vista the earth fell away even more, to a low plain from which 
          erupted the Collegiate Peaks, the most formidable range in the lower 
          48 with 16 fourteeners. They were purple and snowcapped, and spread 
          over a 30 mile front, as in the anthem. I descended into town with a 
          Rocky Mountain high<em>.</em></font></p>
