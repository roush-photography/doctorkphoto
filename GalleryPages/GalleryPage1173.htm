        <p align="center"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><em><font size="3">I 
          shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
          Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
          Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-<br>
          I took the one less traveled by, <br>
          And that has made all the difference.<br>
          Robert Frost</font></em></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
          is a volume of words. Ever since a chisel was taken to stone, the written 
          word has helped plot the course of human history. Consider the influence 
          on civilizations of the Bible, the Koran, the Declaration of Independence, 
          a poem by Robert Frost , or a sonnet by William Shakespeare. President 
          Kennedy, speaking at Amherst College, said it this way in one of his 
          last speeches: &quot;When power leads man toward arrogance, poetry reminds 
          him of his limitations. When power corrupts, poetry cleanses.&quot; 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          this is also a volume of photographs. Edgar Allan Poe stated in 1840 
          that photography was the greatest scientific advancement of his day. 
          Hard to argue with that. Then science begat art, and no art form transforms 
          human apathy more than photography. Glance at any collection of historical 
          photographs: the mushroom cloud over Hiroshima, shootings at Kent State 
          University, the Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk, or perhaps the most iconic 
          photograph of all time, <em>Earthrise</em>, taken from the moon by astronaut 
          Bill Anders in 1968. We absorb the messages of these powerful pictures 
          and they move us. Empathy and insight come together at once, and we 
          want to cheer, or we want to change the world and bring about a better 
          day.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It 
          is quite remarkable when a picture of a starving child in Biafra is 
          followed by food shipments from around the world. Remarkable, too, when 
          images of the<em> Sharpville Massacre </em> mobilize world opinion against 
          apartheid in South Africa. Or when <em>Earthrise, </em>man's first look 
          at his tiny blue home from space, changes his perception of the planet, 
          from big world to small world. This then is the power of photography.

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Untouchables, 
          or Dalits, the lowest of the Hindu caste system, comprise 15 percent 
          of India's population. They are considered dregs, polluted, and do only 
          the filthiest work. They live separate from the rest of Hindu society 
          and are not allowed to enter temples or take water from local wells. 
          Even their shadows are forbidden to touch other Hindus. Gandhi tried 
          to change all this with little success. One might say if Gandhi can't 
          do it, no one can. But then Gandhi would never give up. Perhaps this 
          is the image that will end the caste system. </font></p>
