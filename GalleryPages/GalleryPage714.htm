          out of ten Bhutanese are farmers, eking out a simple subsistence from 
          small plots of marginally arable land. Skill level is low, the result 
          of enforced isolation for centuries. This is a nation betwixt and between 
          the medieval and modern world. Life expectancy and literacy are low 
          and infant mortality high despite recent progress in education and health 
          care. Most of Bhutan remains an unspoiled land of farmers and yak herders, 
          living as their forefathers did long ago in the cool, green heights. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Because 
          of this isolation and reverence for the past, Bhutan has been slow to 
          develop its natural resources. Consequently forests are virgin and rivers 
          mostly free-flowing. More than half of the land surface has been set 
          aside as forest preserves, lush oak and evergreen spangled with rhododendrons, 
          where endangered species such as tiger, snow leopard, and wild oxen 
          hang out. There are, in addition, 500 or so species of birds. As Bhutan 
          gradually opens its doors to the 21st century, a stated objective of 
          the king is to do so with minimal impact on the environment.</font></p>

        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">My guide 
          and I passed in and out of shadow, up slippery trails and worn steps, 
          and into the warmth of late morning. We were ascending 3,000 feet to 
          Tiger's Nest Monastery, national symbol of Bhutan. From the valley floor 
          the monastery appeared to have been chiseled out of the granite face, 
          teetering on the brink. As I gained the heights the land below appeared 
          like a green shag carpet of forests broken by fields and farmhouses. 
          At the top it was as if I had been inserted into a world where time 
          stood still. And perhaps it did. </font></p>
