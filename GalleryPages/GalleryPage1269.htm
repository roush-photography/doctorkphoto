        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Louis 
          Leakey was a British paleoanthropologist who made many discoveries and 
          much commotion in the mid 20th century. He burst onto the world stage 
          out of Olduvai Gorge, in East Africa, with fossilized evidence that 
          this indeed was the cradle of mankind, the Garden of Eden, if you will. 
          This discovery, in 1959, rocked the bedrock of anthropology which had 
          assumed that man's roots were in Asia. But look out world, for Louis 
          Leakey was not about to rest on his &quot;missing link&quot; laurels. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;Unfortunately, 
          behavior does not fossilize,&quot; Leakey was fond of saying. He wanted 
          to know about the behavior of the species he had unearthed. Confident 
          to the point of being evangelical, he possessed swagger enough to propose 
          that the only way to get a glimpse of early man's behavior would be 
          to study his closest relatives in the wild, the great apes. Closest 
          relatives? Great apes? Yikes! This notion was so preposterous at the 
          time that his colleagues (including wife Dr. Mary) thought he'd gone 
          mad. But Leakey was not easily dissuaded. With his flowing white mane 
          and boundless good cheer, the &quot;African Lion&quot; usually got what 
          he wanted. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">He proposed 
          a project that would be costly and time consuming and test all his powers 
          of persuasion. With unflagging enthusiasm and larger-than-life charisma, 
          he mustered support, mostly from National Geographic, to send not one, 
          but three researchers into the jungles of Africa and Asia, to do what 
          had never been done. They would live with the great apes, become members 
          of their society, and painstakingly record their most intricate behaviors. 
          It would take years and impossible patience. And Leakey rocked the proverbial 
          boat again by insisting that only women could pull this off. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">He dispatched 
          Jane Goodall to Gombe Stream, Tanzania in 1960; Dian Fossey to Karisoke, 
          Rwanda in 1967; and Birute Galdikas to Camp Leakey, Borneo in 1971, 
          to study chimps, gorillas, and orangutans, respectively. None of &quot;Leakey's 
          Trimates,&quot; as they became known, had prior academic training or 
          experience in field biology. It was just the way he wanted it-three 
          driven women with blank slates, and therefore, no preconceptions. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The trimates 
          would vindicate Leakey. All three obtained doctorates in primatology 
          from leading universities (Oxford, Colgate, and U.C.L.A.) and established 
          research stations that are still churning out data in 2015. This work 
          has been hailed as some of the most important in the history of science, 
          and, as an aside, has sparked a worldwide interest in the plight of 
          the great apes, all three endangered. </font></p>
