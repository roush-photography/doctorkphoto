        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There 
          is a huge highway feeding wildlife parts to east Asia for use in traditional 
          medicine, mainly to China, though Vietnam and the Philippines are rapidly 
          expanding markets. This, despite the fact that all of these nations, 
          on paper at least, ban the import of endangered animals or their parts. 
          And most of these species are endangered! Many are vanishing from the 
          earth because of this illegal trade run by an international crime syndicate 
          that rivals drug and weapons trafficking in size and scope ($20 billion 
          per year). The poor countries of Southeast Asia and India are ready 
          sources. They are home to the right species, much poverty, and lax law 
          enforcement. What villager living in squalor can resist hundreds of 
          dollars to shoot an endangered animal? They could care less about <em>endangered</em>, 
          or that the syndicate behind the scenes in China will get up to $150,000 
          for the tiger he killed. Or $50,000 for a pound of ground up rhino horn 
          (more than gold, heroin, or cocaine). </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This insatiable 
          demand for wildlife parts has soared in the past 25 years, in tandem 
          with the expanding middle and wealthy classes in China and elsewhere. 
          And China has even become an exporter of this contraband, to 26 countries 
          around the world, including the U.S. with its large Asian population. 
          The ingredients are used in the same remedies that have been prescribed 
          for centuries, the concoctions compiled in <em>The Great Herbal<font face="Georgia">, 
          </font></em><font face="Georgia">written in 1596 during the Ming Dynasty 
          by emperor Shen Nung. All efforts to persuade the Chinese that these 
          treatments have no basis in science have been dismal failures. So the 
          demand continues, and for the rarest of the rare-tiger, rhino, mountain 
          gorilla, and soon the elephant-it threatens to hunt them off the planet.
