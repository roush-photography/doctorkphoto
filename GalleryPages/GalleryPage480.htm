        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Like most 
          of the world's charismatic megavertebrates (whale, elephant, lion, tiger), 
          the sea turtle is in a race for survival. Once so abundant that Columbus 
          described the Caribbean as &quot;full of floating rocks,&quot; all eight 
          species are now threatened or endangered. There is a single solitary 
          reason for this plight and that is <em>man</em>, his activities and 
          his indifference.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The sea 
          turtle's dilemma demonstrates just how dominant man's dominion over 
          the earth has become. Some turtle species are shallow water. Unfortunately 
          for them so too are man and his nets. But even deep water species are 
          endangered. They must periodically surface for air and likely as not 
          they will encounter something human along the way. And the sea turtle 
          is pelagic, or open ocean, which again would seem like a good thing. 
          Yet females must come to shore one night a year to lay eggs. On land 
          the sluggish turtles don't have a chance. Imagine then how the eggs 
          fare. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For this 
          ponderous giant life starts out dangerous and then gets worse. Every 
          stroke of the flipper seems to dodge or weave some hazard along life's 
          treacherous way. Eggs are ingested as food and (you guessed it!) aphrodesiac. 
          Hatchlings are gulped down like hors d'oeuvres by birds and mammals. 
          Nesting beaches are buried beneath condominiums. The few turtles that 
          do make it to adulthood can be killed for food, ground up by dredges, 
          plowed by propellers, poisoned by pollution, strangled by plastic, or 
          entangled (by the hundreds of thousands) in fishermen's nets. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Where 
          have all the floating rocks gone? Gone to indifference, every one.</font></p>
