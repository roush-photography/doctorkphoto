        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Geeks 
          of the world, ponder this. Wispy monarch butterflies, floating like 
          confetti over the United States in summertime, in a northerly direction, 
          finally arrive in Canada in early fall. There they mate, lay eggs, and 
          die. The newly hatched butterflies detect the autumnal ebb in the photoperiod 
          and make a u-turn to head south. These native Canadians draw a bead 
          on a single mountaintop in Mexico, 3000 miles away. With beating wings 
          and the grace of god, they are soon there, resting in the same Oyumel 
          fir trees as their forebears did. <em>Six generations ago</em>! How 
          on earth? </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">British 
          Naval Captain James Cook is considered by many to be the greatest of 
          human navigators. But is this really so? His credentials are definitely 
          impressive. He sailed around the world twice and explored much of the 
          Pacific Ocean in the mid 1700's. Cook used the technology of his time, 
          a compass, a sextant, and the stars to find his way on the vast ocean.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1769 
          Cook received a detailed map from Polynesians in Tahiti of all the major 
          islands of the South Pacific, most he had never seen or heard of. Obviously 
          they'd sailed these waters for a long time. Tupaia, a Tahitian priest, 
          then joined Cook on his ship, the Endeavor, and proceeded to dazzle 
          the British captain and crew by taking them to unknown and faraway islands, 
          without the use of navigational aids. <em> By dead reckoning only</em>! 
          Just like the monarch butterfly. </font></p>

          the greatest navigator of them all?</font></p>
