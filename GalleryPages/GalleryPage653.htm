        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          national park system has grown considerably since its inception and 
          now includes 401 units, 84 million acres, and 22,000 employees. Fifty-nine 
          of the units are national parks. Under this agency are also national 
          monuments, seashores, scenic trails, wild and scenic rivers, as well 
          as battlefields and other historic sites. Truly a collection of world-class 
          treasures, this is a monumental outdoor museum. And, with a prime purpose 
          of educating the people, it has been called &quot;the nation's largest 
          university.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">These 
          public lands are among the last natural reserves for America's plants 
          and animals. The park service has been given the task of providing space 
          for countless species in a world of dwindling wild places. The parks 
          then become outdoor laboratories for scholars from within and without 
          the park system. Their contribution to our understanding of this imperiled 
          planet cannot be weighed. How can we restore the Everglades? Can we 
          reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone? Which wildfires should we put out? 
          Which fires should we start? Why are spruce trees dying in Colorado 
          and should we try to do anything about it? The litany of questions is 
          endless, but out of all the mystery has come great wisdom. We <em>know</em> 
          how to be better stewards of our planet. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          not all is perfect in parkdom. The great university faces many challenges 
          stemming from too little money and too much love. Parks are literally 
          being visited to their detriment without the funding for even routine 
          upkeep. Crowds in the more popular parks give visitors a &quot;citified&quot; 
          experience rather than the picture postcard solitude they expect. Incredibly, 
          nearly 300 million people a year visit a national park system that is 
          two billion dollars behind in repairs. Big numbers that add up to big 
          problems. Perhaps a little more money and a little less love is in order.</font></p>
