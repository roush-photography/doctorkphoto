          Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.<br>
          Mark Twain</font></em></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          new millennium is five days old. I book passage on and board the <em>Yermelova</em>, 
          an ancient Russian icebreaker, in Ushuaia, Argentina, the world's most 
          southerly city. The <em>Yermelova's </em>rusted hull and dilapidated 
          decks do not instill confidence. I make note of the nearest lifeboat 
          and pay attention at safety drills. We are making the long, circuitous 
          voyage from Ushuaia to the Falkland Islands, then South Georgia, and 
          finally the Antarctica Peninsula. We will close the loop by sailing 
          across the infamous Drake Passage, stormiest of seas, past the forlorn 
          headland of Cape Horn, the southernmost tip of South America, then back 
          to Ushuaia. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">By 
          any measure this is an adventure. Not Shackleton or Scott mind you, 
          but macho by Y2K standards. There are no balmy ports of call, feather 
          pillows, or medivac. No five star anything. More like one, or zero. 
          The <em>Yermelova</em> is not a cruise ship. She will roll with the 
          punches, so everyone has a patch or pill, something to tame the tempest 
          in their gut. On the plus side, I've been told the ship's cabins have 
          heaters that occasionally work. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Rather 
          than a luxury cruise, this is a floating seminar with a spectacular 
          outdoor lab for nature enthusiasts. Lectures are offered by naturalists, 
          geologists, photographers, and other assorted experts. We will spend 
          long days at sea, reading, watching for whales, and marveling at the 
          flight of the albatross as it glides effortlessly over the rolling sea. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          mostly there are the shore excursions, hours and hours each day to mingle 
          with, observe, and photograph the fabulous wildlife of the Southern 
          realm, twice as tame and nearly as inquisitive as we are. It should 
          make for high adventure that some say rivals East Africa for nature, 
          red in tooth and claw.</font></p>
