        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This is 
          my first visit to the pencil thin peninsula of Baja, a state of Mexico, 
          yet worlds apart from the &quot;mainland.&quot; Home base is the quaint 
          village of Loreto, worth a visit by itself. But this trip is not about 
          culture. My mission is to see and photograph the California gray whales. 
          And maybe, just maybe, have an up close and personal encounter with 
          them. This will be my second major whale excursion. The first was in 
          the Caribbean. I figure Baja will have to be anticlimactic after what 
          happened with the humpbacks of the Silver Banks (see previous page). 
          Time would prove me wrong. The gray whales of Baja had a few surprises 
          of their own. </font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Each autumn 
          the eastern Pacific population of gray whales leaves its feeding grounds 
          in the Bering and Chukchi Seas, off Alaska, and swims 5,000 miles to 
          San Ignacio Lagoon of Baja to calve, nurse, and mate. The shallow lagoon 
          is perfect for the whales to do their thing, and for us to see and hopefully 
          interact with them. And I am told that several hundred are waiting for 
          us. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">During 
          the whaling era the grays understandably tried to avoid humans, though 
          not very successfully. For more than a century whalers hunted them along 
          the Baja coast, eventually reducing the stock to endangered status. 
          In 1946 total protection was granted and numbers have gradually crept 
          up. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Whalers 
          nicknamed the grays &quot;devilfish&quot; and &quot;hardhead.&quot; 
          One of their ploys was to harpoon a calf first to lure its mother into 
          range. This method didn't always go according to plan. At times the 
          enraged mom would attack and overturn their skiff by using her head 
          as a ram. Or she might simply crush it with a whack of her massive tail. 
          For some reason the whalers took offense. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Over a 
          three day period we visited the whales six times, two hours each, in 
          small boats called <em>pangas</em>. During every encounter several &quot;friendly&quot; 
          moms with calves approached us for reasons known only to whales. They 
          seemed genuinely curious and playful, but this is human reasoning. Who 
          really knows? After all these are wild creatures. We observed the entire 
          spectrum of surface activity, including blowing (sometimes right in 
          our faces), breaching, spy hopping, and fin and tail slapping. Moms 
          and babes would occasionally swim toward the boat, then turn on their 
          backs to have their bellies rubbed. Of course, we obliged, even as we 
          smiled and squealed, and took photos.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But the 
          highlight was when a calf would swim right up to the boat, then lift 
          its head out of the water to be scratched, coddled, or whatever, staring 
          at us with trusting eyes. This was no freak event as with the humpback. 
          It happened repeatedly with different whales. It has happened many times 
          in the past. Mom was always close by, observing, but apparently unconcerned 
          by baby's behavior. No aggression was shown, as in the whaling days. 
          As far as we know this is the only occurrence of such maternal tolerance 
          in the &quot;wild kingdom.&quot; The &quot;devilfish&quot; seem to have 
          forgiven us for our whaling atrocities. Perhaps there's a lesson here.
