        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
          is it! After two years of training and three weeks of grunt it is finally 
          time to go for the summit of Cerro Aconcagua, highest point in all the 
          Americas. We stuff our packs with gear and grub, wrap our bodies in 
          hi-tech layers, then unzip the tent to greet the early morning (translation-12:01 
          a.m.) with an unenthusiastic whine. Chad, our head guide, is looking 
          laudably perky, scarfing down eggs, cheese, and porridge with greedy 
          smackings. He is full of early-morning happiness that draws looks of 
          disapproval from his troops, none of whom has an appetite. After the 
          morning hygeine, I force down coffee, two Snickers bars, and some raisins, 
          while staring at the stars to soothe my nerves. A sliver of moon, brilliantly 
          white, hangs in the pitch black sky. The mountain is still there, naked 
          of life, warmth, and safety. At half past midnight some unknown force 
          launches us into the new millennium and toward the summit of the Americas.

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Like 
          pack mules we plod ponderously along, laden by heavy loads and breath, 
          heads down, eyes fixed, a march of the dead. We see nothing and hear 
          only the cadence of rock under boot. One of my Snickers wants to come 
          up for air but I refuse. Soon I am feeling better. Not gladiatorial 
          mind you, but pretty pumped up. My mantra is &quot;It's only walking.&quot; 
          All I have to do is put one foot in front of the other. For 18 hours. 
          Going uphill. With 40% of the oxygen at sea level. I follow Chad and 
          his pumping testosterone, and try to draw on his strength. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
          stop occasionally, to rest and breathe and survey the craggy splendor. 
          It is a perfect day. Smaller mountains recede to infinity, sparkling 
          with sunlight. We are at 21,000 feet. Only one peak towers over us now-Aconcagua-tallest 
          peak in the world outside the Himalayas. How hip can it get?</font></p>
