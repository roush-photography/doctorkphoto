          arrive safely in a well-preserved body;<br>
          but rather to skid in broadside, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming 
          &quot;Wow! What a ride!&quot;<br>
          Hunter Thompson</em></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">After 
          25 days and 600 miles across the gravel pit of Tibet, &quot;roof of 
          the world<em>,&quot; </em>astride a mountain bike , I am ready to cross 
          the finish line in Kathmandu, Nepal. And to be on foot again! The saddle 
          has ground my backside into a giant blister laced with raw nerves. Every 
          bump in the road is a stab in the butt. No wonder a popular sporting 
          magazine rated this the toughest organized bike ride on the planet! 
          They forgot to mention this in the brochure. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          there is one more phase to complete before I arrive in Kathmandu, and 
          am finally free of the now dreaded cold, headwinds, and dust (macho 
          for a maybe a week). I poise my <em>Litespeed</em> on the edge of Tibet, 
          gaze out toward the horizon for a long while, then take a deep breath 
          and launch myself into Nepal. What lies ahead are two days and 9000 
          feet of curvaceous descent, the longest downhill in the world, back 
          down to the land of oxygen, asphalt, and the sweetest warmth in the 
          world. And downhill means no peddling! All I have to do is hang on.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Which 
          I manage to do. Two days later I groan into Kathmandu, one time adventure 
          capital of the world and watering hole for outlaws and Indiana Jones 
          wannabes. I slam on the brakes one last time and dismount, feeling less 
          than victorious. There are no cheering crowds. No reporters. I am not 
          disappointed. Weary, wobbly, tattered, ill with bowel complaints, and 
          15 pounds lighter, I hobble over to the nearest kiosk and purchase the 
          only Western fare to be had: a large box of corn flakes, covered in 
          dust. I then check into a local hostel, sprawl across the bed and feast 
          on the dry cereal, chasing it with warm Coca-Cola (don't even think 
          about using ice here), manna from heaven after a month of porridge and 
          pancakes. I opt for some serious isolation and relaxation, having had 
          my fill of adventure and company for awhile. (next photo)</font></p>
