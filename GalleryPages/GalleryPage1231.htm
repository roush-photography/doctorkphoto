          Sir Edmond Hillary</font></em></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The United 
          States at the turn of the 20th century was a land of farms and small 
          towns. New York was our only large city (pop. 3 million) and the word 
          <em>&quot;</em>megacity&quot; hadn't even been invented yet. Immigrants 
          arrived on Ellis Island in droves, mostly from Europe in those days. 
          A fledgling automobile industry was seen as no match for the horse and 
          buggy in turn-of-the-century rural America. In the nation's few urban 
          centers the fashion of the day for women was the hat, the bigger the 
          better, adorned with showy feathers and stuffed bird carcasses. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">America 
          was, however, poised for change. The concept of conservation was being 
          whispered by a few visionaries who condemned what Thoreau called &quot;our 
          war with wilderness.&quot; And it was none too soon as developers stood 
          at the rim of the Grand Canyon and roared, white-tailed deer were hunted 
          to near extinction in some states, and more herons and egrets adorned 
          hats than waded in the Everglades!</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          dawn of the new century saw help arrive in the form of advocates for 
          wildlife. A sign of the new times took place on March 25, 1900, when 
          Congress passed the Lacey Act, meant to stop the slaughter of wading 
          birds by commercial plume hunters. It was a landmark piece of legislation 
          that hinted at a new ethic. Less than a year later a man called &quot;Teddy&quot; 
          became president, the first person ever to &quot;carry a big stick&quot; 
          for conservation. His list of achievements protecting wilderness and 
          wildlife are legendary, enough that his chiseled countenance forever 
          watches over us from Mt. Rushmore, in the distinguished company of Washington, 
          Lincoln, and Jefferson. His booming personality single-handedly launched 
          what has become known as the Century of Conservation<em>, </em>and he 
          in turn has been called the &quot;Father of Conservation&quot; in the 
          United States. </font></p>
