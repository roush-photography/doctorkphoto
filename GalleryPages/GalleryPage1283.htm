        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">My 
          next Australian adventure is in the remote far north, referred to as 
          the Never Never. This is an alien land of killer heat and monsoonal 
          rains. And that's just the weather. There are also snakes, crocs, and 
          that infamous bubble of doom, the box jellyfish, any one of which can 
          put you away, for good. My first stop in the north is Arnhem Land, home 
          of the aboriginals. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Around 
          evening campfires at Mt. Borradaile I listen to tales of a people and 
          their Dreamtime, the Aboriginal version of a creation myth. It seems 
          all of northern Australia, despite the remarkable isolation (no paved 
          roads, few people), carries the heavy stamp of man. Aboriginals have 
          been here for a long, long time. Around 60,000 years ago, (alas! some 
          would say 100,000), a battered raft or two washed ashore on a wild and 
          far-flung beach of northern Australia. The world's first ancient mariners 
          had stumbled into the mystery of history, where they remain today. It 
          was man's first encounter with an entirely new land mass, separate and 
          distinct from the jungles and caves of Africa and Eurasia. How on earth 
          did it happen? </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
          can only speculate. During the history of man there has not been an 
          overland route to Australia, this much is known. Therefore humans arrived 
          by sea. The world was very different 60,000 years ago, locked in the 
          grip of the Pleistocene when much of North America, Europe, and Asia 
          were covered with glaciers up to two miles thick. There was so much 
          sequestered ice that sea levels were 400 feet lower than today. The 
          result was Indonesia joined to Asia, probably as far south as today's 
          island of Timor, at the time only 50 miles from Australia. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          say &quot;only&quot;<em> </em>50 miles. Think back to prehistoric times-the 
          first Eurasians migrating slowly southward to the tip of Timor. Imagine 
          that first vision of the vast and moody sea and the myths and superstitions 
          which inevitably sprang up around it. Then consider that even in the 
          relatively enlightened time of Columbus, only 500 years ago, sailors 
          were afraid to sail out of sight of land for fear of sea monsters and 
          falling off the edge of the earth, among other things. And they had 
          seaworthy vessels and 3000 years of sailing history in their blood by 
          then. But a primitive campsite in a remote corner of Kakadu National 
          Park confirms that in some mysterious manner the peopling of Australia 
          began at least 60,000 years ago, 57,000 years before there is any evidence 
          of maritime travel, anywhere in the world! In the ensuing interval the 
          glaciers melted, raising sea levels and submerging the landing beaches, 
          and any archaeological evidence that might have told the story.</font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          beach in the photograph, along the Arafura Sea at low tide in Australia's 
          far north, is a truly wild place. There are no paved roads for hundreds 
          of miles. Sab is on the left and we are accompanied by two aboriginals 
          who have taken us to collect &quot;bush tucker&quot;-clams, witchetty 
          grubs, crabs, and fish- gathered from land, sea, and billabong without 
          modern implements. The tucker will be consumed sushi style or roasted 
          over a fire, as the aboriginals have done for millennia. A French filmmaker 
          (fourth from left) is here to document the adventure for television.
