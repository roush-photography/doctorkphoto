          late afternoon and I am with the chimpanzees of Gombe, the very same 
          chimps that Jane Goodall lived with for years. I have followed them 
          for several days, fascinated, as she was, by their similarity to us. 
          We are the closest of kin and share more DNA (99.5%) than a zebra does 
          with a horse. </font></p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">After 
          a sudden but brief shower the sun beams through a break in the clouds. 
          I bask contentedly in its warm glow, blending into the forest, a part 
          of its vanishing mystery. At times like these I feel the presence of 
          God, a mystical experience that happens occasionally to those who spend 
          time alone in nature. The air is filled with birdsong and the ratchety, 
          scratchy sounds of cicadas.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Against 
          the backdrop of breaking clouds in an indigo sky, lightning flickers 
          and thunder rumbles. In the magic light I become acutely aware of various 
          shapes and colors that envelop me, especially the leaves, each spangled 
          with a necklace of raindrops. The scent of wet jungle is heavy in the 
          air. I hear a crash through the canopy and look up to see a troupe of 
          colobus monkeys in flight. A young village lady strolls gracefully along 
          the nearby shore of Lake Tanganyika. And in the distant jungle a chimpanzee 
          defends his territory with the familiar &quot;pant-hoot,&quot; as Jane 
          described it. The message-trespass at your own risk!</font></p>
