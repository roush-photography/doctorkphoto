<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><em>I 
          come to Australia, as many people do<br>
          To see the old koala, hitch a ride on a kangaroo<br>
          John Denver</em></font></p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Extra 
          gas and spare tires stowed, we climb aboard Sab's Land Cruiser. With 
          a grinding of gears, a couple of bucks, and a lively but unintended 
          salute of the windshield wipers, we are off, drawing a bead on Kakadu 
          National Park, a World Heritage Site of the Top End.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Sab 
          is Australian through and through, with the leathery skin, akubra hat, 
          and safari shorts to prove it. In the first 10 minutes he says <em>mate</em> 
          and <em>bloke</em> so many times I lose count. I assume it's a show 
          for the tourist. (time would prove me wrong-they really do talk like 
          Aussies in Australia). </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">These 
          mates of the outback look as if they spend every day doing tough stuff 
          and every night drinking, which is pretty much what they do. They're 
          the kind of blokes you might choose to start a colony somewhere, and 
          for whom a bit scared is the maximum allowed. Sab and company have their 
          own proud 200 year history and worldview, and no longer consider themselves 
          England's bucolic cousins. Nor are they inclined to kowtow to pushy 
          Americans.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">After 
          a morning of paved roads we finally encounter reality, the washboard 
          dirt track of the outback. So begins nonstop axle action sufficient 
          to rattle teeth and scatter bowel gas as well as nearby wallabies. Every 
          few hours we zip by an oncoming vehicle with a <em>whoosh</em> and a 
          cloud of dust. Occasionally a kangaroo bounces by on his way to somewhere. 
          Neatly arranged termite mounds are the dominant landscape feature, like 
          so many headstones, commemorating eons of wind, fire, and flood. (next
