        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">So 
          species are falling like dominos. What of it? Is concern just a sentimental 
          attachment to the past, or does it really matter? If biodiversity is 
          reduced by half this century, as predicted, will there be a direct negative 
          impact on humankind? The answer, according to science, is unequivocal. 
          Absolutely it matters!</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Species 
          do not exist in isolation. Each is part of a community of interdependent 
          organisms that have adapted to each other and their environment in ways 
          that sustain the system. These units are called ecosystems and they 
          spread around the globe, blending seamlessly at the edges to create 
          an ecologically integrated planet. Examples of ecosystems are tropical 
          rain forests, grasslands, coral reefs, and tundra, to name but a few. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">So 
          each species is connected, directly or indirectly, to every other species 
          in a complex web of interactions that has made possible our living planet. 
          The loss of a single species may pass unnoticed in the big picture, 
          and certainly will to a hyperkinetic&quot;me, me, me&quot; alpha predator 
          like man. But mass extinction is another story. The predicted loss of 
          species in this century will impact the entire planet-like an asteroid, 
          only much slower. If we continue the current pace of ecosystem destruction, 
          species elimination, and climate change, the life support systems of 
          planet earth will become seriously compromised. There is irrefutable 
          evidence that this is happening right now. The earth will survive. Life 
          will survive. But will our species survive?</font></p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          elephant seal, giant of the pinniped world, was hunted to near extinction 
          for its blubber from which oil was obtained. International protection 
          and the &quot;age of petroleum&quot; have given the species a second 
          chance, though many threats remain. Who'd a thunk it? Wildlife conservation-another 
          benefit of crude oil. </font></p>
