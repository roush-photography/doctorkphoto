        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
          humans cannot help but empathize with our fellow creatures. We share 
          thousands of years of history, of depending on plants and animals for 
          our very survival. And we share the miracle of life itself, those common 
          threads of DNA and consciousness. Therefore we feel a powerful sense 
          of loss when a life-form vanishes forever. The world is suddenly a tad 
          more lonely, the foundations of our own existence a little more fragile.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">With 
          the new environmental consciousness of the mid 20th century people began 
          to take notice of the plight of threatened species. The United States 
          has lost an estimated 630 of them since Columbus changed America from 
          a land of natives to one of Europeans. In the turbulent Sixties this 
          was no longer acceptable. Save the whales! Save the eagles! In fact 
          Save the World! became the new rallying cry of an energetic and rebellious 
          youth. And they got results.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Earlier 
          in the century the bison and the egret had been snatched from the jaws 
          of oblivion. It was a clarion call to action. Species could be saved, 
          if only we cared. Turns out we did.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          1973, in an hour of sweeping vision, congress passed a ground-breaking 
          piece of legislation that amounted, in effect, to a Bill of Rights for 
          other species. Nothing like this had ever been tried before, here, there, 
          or anywhere. The United States of America put the rest of the world 
          on notice-we did care after all. The Endangered Species Act was based 
          on the notion that any species might ultimately prove beneficial to 
          mankind. But it went further. It advanced the radical idea that species 
          had a right to exist for their own sake. This nation was bound by law 
          to protect species threatened with extincion even if sacrifice was required 
          on our part. In the 40 years hence the average yearly sacrifice per 
          taxpayer, per year, has been 10 cents. Perhaps the best dime ever spent.</font></p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          most notable beneficiary of the ESA has been the American bald eagle, 
          threatened in the lower 48 states by hunting, habitat loss, and the 
          pesticide DDT. A bounty led to the shooting of more than 100,000 eagles. 
          With the banning of DDT and hunting, populations have gradually recovered.
