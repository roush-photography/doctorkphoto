      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        definitive history of Easter Island will probably never be written. Many 
        versions of the truth have arisen from the archaeological shards of the 
        19th century, and there is much scholarly fussing.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">By 
        the time of discovery by the Dutch on Easter Sunday of 1722 the oral history 
        had mostly vanished to the ages. What they &quot;discovered&quot; were 
        embattled Stone Age clans engaged in constant warfare and practicing slavery 
        and cannibalism. Most lived in makeshift caves hacked out of hillsides, 
        a few in flimsy reed huts. These natives had no clue about the great monuments 
        and statuary that lay scattered about their tiny cosmos and which told 
        of a glorious past. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">If 
        any bit of historical truth had survived the pre-European turmoil it would 
        have been doomed by what followed. The death knell to Easter Island culture 
        was dealt by European small pox and Peruvian slave traders in the century 
        following &quot;discovery.&quot; The native islanders were decimated. 
        As few as a hundred wretched souls survived from a population of several 
        thousand. Gone were chiefs and scholars as well as <em>rongorongo</em>, 
        the only form of Polynesian writing ever discovered.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">So 
        we are left to sift through the science, of rocks, petroglyphs, and pollen, 
        to piece together a piecemeal truth. The lessons of Easter Island come 
        hard. Sweeping conclusions are born and die with each new discovery. And 
        yet they abound. What follows is a simplistic account of what may have 
        happened to Polynesia's most advanced statement. It most assuredly contains 
        elements of truth as well as myth. (continued with next photograph)</font></p>
