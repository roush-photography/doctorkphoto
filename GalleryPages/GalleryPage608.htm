        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Eons ago 
          , when the South American continent was joined to Africa, the Pantanal 
          must have been a part of original Eden. Biodiversity is stunning, even 
          today, after 200 years of nature in the crosshairs. The world's attention 
          has only recently been focused on this war on wildlife. It was none 
          too soon.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Commercial 
          hunting for wildlife was outlawed in Brazil in 1987, but very little 
          changed as a result. The law was &quot;on paper&quot; but nowhere else. 
          Enforcement required tax dollars, and that, of course, went to pay corrupt 
          officials to not enforce the law. After all this is Latin America. When 
          poachers discovered caiman by the zillions in the Pantanal, a &quot;crocodile 
          rush&quot; was on, for skins, of course. Some have estimated that a 
          million were shot every year in the eighties to supply the worldwide 
          market for fashion accessories. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hunters 
          stalked the sloughs by night, with lights, to reveal the distincive 
          eyeshine. Then bam, right between the eyes. No sporting chance. After 
          all this was a war for money. The following day the carcasses were skinned 
          and salted. It was win-win, for poachers in the Pantanal and merchants 
          in New York and London. And don't forget the vultures. The stench of 
          rotten meat hung over the swamp like a shroud. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And 
          these poachers were not picky. They killed anything they could sell. 
          The mass trade in crocodile skins was supplemented by more exotic, and 
          rare, wildlife-jaguars, ocelot, otters, anaconda-that could not stand 
          up to an army of poachers. But not to worry. There would be another 
          spin-off. The exotic pet trade. Thousands of macaws were taken from 
          the Pantanal each year and put into tiny cages around the world so their 
          &quot;owners&quot; could teach them to talk. Most mercifully died before 
          they learned the first word. (next photo)</font></p>
