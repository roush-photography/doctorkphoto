          John Kerry</font></em></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">One of 
          the most unforgettable photographs of all time was snapped in 1972 and 
          hastened America's withdrawal from the war. On June 8 of that year a 
          South Vietnamese pilot inadvertently dropped napalm on the Cao Dai temple 
          at Trang Bang, a small village 25 miles west of Saigon. Gobs of the 
          burning goo, a &quot;breath of hell&quot; at 4000 degrees, splashed 
          on several children who were hiding from the strike in the temple. One 
          child was killed and one, Kim Phuc, age nine, was severely injured.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Kim 
          tore off her flaming clothes and ran naked into the streets and into 
          the eyes of history. Nick Ut, a photographer born in South Vietnam but 
          reared in England, snapped a Pulitzer Prize winning photo of Kim that 
          portrayed the horrors of war perhaps as well as any image ever taken. 
          The look of pain and terror on the child's face was flashed immediately 
          around a shocked world. The picture continues to be widely published 
          today. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">After 
          snapping the photo, Ut doused the naked Kim with water and rushed her 
          to a hospital in Saigon. She was given no chance to live by the doctors 
          and set aside in a makeshift morgue to die while the staff cared for 
          others deemed more likely to survive. Kim's father, who had been separated 
          from his child during the melee, eventually found her and begged the 
          doctors to do anything they could. They agreed, and she did survive, 
          after a long and painful rehabilitation.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          battle to survive her injuries was followed by an equally difficult 
          battle to survive emotionally in a war-torn and corrupt country that 
          insisted on using her as propaganda against the West. Kim defected to 
          Canada in 1992 and is now a UNESCO spokesperson for world peace. Her 
          story, chronicled in the book <em>The Girl In the Picture</em>, by Denise 
          Chong, is as gripping as the photo.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><br>
          <font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Recently 
          I met Kim's family , still living in her former home in Trang Bang. 
          I spent two of the most poignant hours of my life reliving her story 
          with them, in words, pictures, and videos. Much of this information, 
          as well as the picture, are available in the above book and on the internet.
