        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia">I am at Caiman Ranch, the first to offer ecotourism 
          in the Pantanal. My horse postholes through sucking mud and wades across 
          shallow ponds. Before long both horse and rider are covered with a slurry 
          of sweat and mud. Still it's two hours before we stop and dismount on 
          a forested island with a really rank odor. This is what brings us here. 
          A bloated, putrid carcass of a bull, the only signs of life the wriggling 
          maggots. Yesterday this was money on the hoof. Today it's a jaguar kill 
          and still money on the hoof. How so?</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">Jaguar kills are not 
          news in these parts. Ranchers are typically alerted by buzzards circling 
          overhead. A professional jaguar hunter, with hounds, is called to the 
          rescue. The cat runs and runs, followed by the dogged hounds. Eventually 
          the weary feline takes to the treetops, to eacape the dogs, whereupon 
          it is shot and left on the ground to rot. Jaguar dust to dust. Sad? 
          It depends on your viewpoint. Illegal? Definitely, but so what? This 
          is a big place with few people and very little law enforcement. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">But things are different 
          now. Conservation groups, in an effort to save the endangered cats, 
          will now pay ranchers for confirmed kills. Caiman Ranch gets a check 
          and in return the jaguar can live. And there is a nice bonus to this 
          arrangement.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">Adventure travelers will 
          pay big bucks for the chance to see a wild jaguar. And jaguars are much 
          less skittish since they aren't dodging bullets any longer. So tourists 
          go home happy which makes the ranchers happy. Ecotourism may indeed 
          be the salvation, of a way of life in the Pantanal and of habitat, for 
          the jaguar and all species that tag along.</font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">My own quest to capture 
          a jaguar on film was spaced over 15 years and 13 trips to South America. 
          The above photo is the &quot;trophy&quot; of that persistence, captured 
          in 2013 in the north Pantanal region of Brazil. </font></p>
