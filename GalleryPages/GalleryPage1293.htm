          a population crisis.<br>
          Mikhail Gorbachev</font></em></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          wild, wild West has moved south, from the U.S. to Brazil, where it is 
          thriving in all its gold, glory, and decadence. The geography has changed 
          but, with a few exceptions, the story and mistakes are more or less 
          the same. The Oregon trail is now the Trans-Amazonia Highway, the Conestoga 
          wagon a rickety old bus, and the prairie homestead is a jungle bungalow. 
          To fuel the migratory fires, California gold has resurfaced in Rondonia. 
          A closer look at the brief and bungled history of Rondonia will shed 
          light on the plight of Brazil's imperiled western wilderness. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The rush 
          began in the early 1980s as population growth in the region soared to 
          15 percent, five times the &quot;explosive&quot; rate as defined by 
          demographers. The &quot;dirt poor&quot; of the east fled west. Sound 
          familiar? They poured out of Rio and Sao Paulo to the steamy hope of 
          Rondonia, a state as far west as Brazil gets. They dreamed of riches, 
          or at least a better life, hacked out of the jungles of Amazonia. The 
          newly paved BR-364, a 900 mile artery through the wilderness, made it 
          easy for hundreds of thousands to switch slums. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Socially 
          the new wild west has repeated, or even surpassed, former frontier debauchery 
          to the north. The lawlessness, greed, and raunchy night music are all 
          there, in the company of women and booze. Add guns to the mix and murder 
          is matter-of-fact. Same ol', same ol'. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But the 
          social ills go beyond guns and STDs. The place is crawling with kids 
          who have no school, or anything else useful to do for that matter. Imagine 
          the mischief they can dream up with all that spare time. Electricity 
          is only for the rich in Rondonia, and stratospheric inflation means 
          few are. Luxuries such as clean air and water, modern health care, and 
          sanitation seem frivolous when you're hungry and homeless. I doubt they're 
          concerned about biodiversity loss, either. </font></p>
