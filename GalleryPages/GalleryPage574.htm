        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For 
          25 years I chased the light from state to state, driven more to explore 
          and document than to save the world, at least initially. Somewhere along 
          the way an uneasy feeling began to nag at me. I became increasingly 
          aware of threats to wildlife and wild places from human encroachment. 
          Nature was under siege. I learned that we are in the midst of the greatest 
          extinction crisis the world has ever known. I watched in dismay as the 
          wild edge of my neighborhood was replaced by urban sprawl. These realizations 
          tore at my heart even as I continued to record the wonders that remained. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Consider 
          the changes in one lifetime. In 1948, the year I was born, Gatlinburg, 
          Tennessee was a backwoods hamlet that boasted a single retail outlet, 
          Ogle's General Store. Today the place is choked with smog and littered 
          with retail pollution. Traffic is bumper to bumper from town to the 
          top of Clingman's Dome. And the rest of the former hamlet is buried 
          under a parking lot. And at Pigeon Forge, just down the road a piece 
          from Gatlinburg, things are worse! Thank you Dollywood. The traffic 
          may not move at all, for hours, and there are even more parking lots. 
          And the most shocking thing about all this is that no one is shocked 
          about it. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Inevitably, 
          the focus of my travels would shift from local to global, with an idea 
          of providing a window to the world through which others could share 
          my vision and, maybe even my concern. We live in a wondrous world, unique 
          in all the universe as far as we know. There are mind-boggling treasures 
          that need protection and some that still await discovery. I came to 
          the conviction that we must somehow find the heart and political will 
          to conserve a share of the natural world (ecologists say 15% of each 
          ecosystem), before it's too late, and no matter the cost. I vowed to 
          use my travel and photography to help make it happen.</font></p>
