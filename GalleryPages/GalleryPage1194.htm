          this fabulous hominid was not content to merely adapt to a changing 
          world. He was about to break the rules, in fact to shatter them to smithereens. 
          About 10,000 years ago man began to do something else that had not been 
          done (the first was walking upright). He began to modify rather than 
          adapt to his environment, making the world fit his needs rather than 
          the other way around. Instead of just hunting and gathering, man learned 
          to domesticate plants and animals. By about 6,000 BCE, in a fertile 
          crescent around the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, in present-day Iraq, 
          the transition was complete. For the first time anywhere in the world 
          man was totally sedentary, living within an artificial ecosystem that 
          he constructed and totally depended upon. This was the beginning of 
          agriculture and the seeds of a revolution. Man was now a farmer and 
          a shepherd, and on his way to becoming a city slicker. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          The Agricultural Revolution was mankind's real &quot;giant leap,&quot; 
          the single most important chapter in the incomparable biography of <em>Homo 
          sapiens</em>. Hunting and gathering groups were egalitarian. They had 
          few possessions, the idea of land ownership was completely alien to 
          them, and goods vital to the group as a whole (for example food) were 
          regarded as belonging to everyone and shared. It took agriculture to 
          change all this. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">From 
          the simple agricultural villages of southwest Asia would come the world 
          we know today-nations with cities and hierarchical, militaristic societies, 
          ruled by religious and political elite with enormous powers over the 
          common citizen. Societies that were broadly egalitarian were replaced 
          by ones with distinct classes and huge differences in wealth. The ability 
          to support people not engaged in food production with an agricultural 
          surplus became the basis for all subsequent cultural and technological 
          advances by humans. And with that we have grazed, plowed, and settled 
          the entire planet, and even placed footprints on the moon in 1969. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          Truly a job well done! And it was all made possible by a farmer. </font></p>
