          But don't ever stop praying for rain<br>
          It's a curious place between hope and desire<br>

        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
          are all guilty of subjectivity, or bias, even the &quot;cold-blooded&quot; 
          scientist. It's only human. All of us look for, and &quot;see&quot; 
          only evidence that confirms what we already believe. The difference 
          is that scientific data are subjected to peer review and replication 
          before acceptance as &quot;truth.&quot; The lay opinion, often based 
          on whim or junk science, is not subjected to scrutiny. We're free to 
          believe what we want. And to complicate matters, even scientific &quot;truth&quot; 
          can be short lived. Vitamin X is good for you today, bad for you tomorrow. 
          This is a source of constant consternation to the public, yet there 
          is no shame in changing one's mind if new data demand it. Uncertainty 
          is inevitable on the front lines of any search for truth, but science 
          will ultimately triumph.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Recently 
          the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of the United Nations, 
          consisting of hundreds of climate scientists from around the world, 
          released a fifth report in 25 years. In it they proclaimed, more emphatically 
          than ever, that global warming is a fact, and that man has contributed 
          substantially to it in the last half of the 20th century by burning 
          fossil fuels. And yet, despite almost universal agreement by the experts 
          (95%), half of all Americans still proudly proclaim their disbelief 
          in either issue. This is significantly more than in other &quot;advanced&quot; 
          countries. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Much research 
          has been done in the past 25 years, most recently out of Yale University, 
          in an effort to explain why Americans are so good at &quot;burying their 
          heads in the sand.&quot; Simplistically, it seems we fall into one of 
          two tribes. The first believes that industry often behaves badly and 
          must be regulated by government. The second believes that government 
          is the problem and should stop meddling in private affairs. Whichever 
          tribe we belong to we want very badly to be accepted. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">So it 
          would seem that peer pressure does not fade with high school graduation 
          at all. It is alive and well at the club, at church, in local bars, 
          and on the golf course. To remain in the graces of our group we will 
          turn a blind eye to science if necessary, especially when it doesn't 
          appear to cause any immediate harm. So we say no to climate change because 
          the urgency is hard to grasp, the effects not immediately apparent. 
          And we can even change our minds later if we need to.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But these 
          really are not trivial issues. The earth's average temperature has increased, 
          in step with rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Glaciers are 
          melting and sea levels are rising. So climate change is real and we 
          are the major cause. Evolution is no longer a theory. It is fact. The 
          evidence for this is incontrovertible. Vaccines are a good thing and 
          the moon rocks are not fake. Being right matters and science has a long 
          track record of getting things right in the end. Science has transported 
          us to the outer reaches of the solar system, given us push button comfort 
          and communication, and nearly doubled our life expectancy, all in a 
          single century. Enough said. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Nevertheless, 
          research is both flawed and biased, the truth elusive. Therefore, this 
          volume, in the words of Ansel Adams, is my &quot;aggressive personal 
          opinion&quot; based on 50 years of exploration and study. It is not 
          necessarily a logical presentation of facts since only mathematics can 
          do that. Conclusions are subject to change as new information becomes 
          available. </font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The roseate 
          spoonbill was on a fast track to extinction only a few years ago. The 
          science of ecology, developed only in the last century, taught us the 
          importance of habitat preservation to species viability. When we set 
          aside nature reserves with intact ecosystems we are astonished at the 
          resilience of most species. The above spoonbill and her kind are doing 
          fine now, simply because we saved them a place.</font></p>
