        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">What 
          is it about one photograph that makes an audience gasp while most others 
          put them to sleep? Photography depends on the triad of light, composition, 
          and subject, blended magically to elicit this response. The photographer 
          seeks to communicate something powerful with his tools and vision, to 
          provide proof that the universe is grander than we dared to dream.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Without 
          light there is no vision or color, much less photography. How light 
          is perceived and captured is the photographer's constant challenge and 
          delight. We watch it illuminate, soften, and dance upon the world. In 
          magic light there are no ordinary moments. More than any other quality 
          it is light that makes us gasp. My mentor, Galen Rowell, ever the rebel, 
          used to say &quot;Look for the light and find a subject to go with it,&quot; 
          an obvious reference to the photgrapher's obsession with subject. Rowell 
          devoted his all too abbreviated life to capturing the essence of mountain 
          light.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Composition 
          is the tiny vignette a photographer places in the frame as he snaps 
          the shutter. It encompasses the geometrical arrangement of subject and 
          supporting elements, as well as perspective. He must reduce a big, messy 
          world to simple, sleek terms. This is the photographer's other immediate 
          and lifelong task. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Capturing 
          the subject at the perfect moment is the most difficult challenge of 
          all and, therefore, these photos are the rarest. The mass of moments 
          are mundane. Often painful patience is required, awaiting the fleeting 
          miracle. And then it happens-hands touch, a smile, an exclamation. A 
          memory!</font></p>
