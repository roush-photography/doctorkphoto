          will take millions of years to correct is loss of species diversity 
          <br>
          by destruction of natural habitats. This is the folly our descendents 
          are least likely to forgive us. <br>

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">So 
          extinction is a natural, necessary, and ongoing process, taking place 
          quietly, with little fanfare, like two species passing in the night. 
          However, mass extinctions, such as the event that made room for you 
          and me (see previous page), is something else entirely. These are catastrophic 
          events that can take life back to its amoeboid beginnings. In the broadest 
          sense they are natural and normal, but definitely not quiet. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Since 
          life began on earth, four billion years ago, there have been five known 
          mass extinctions when most planetary life was eliminated by a tumultuous 
          force. </font><font size="4" face="Georgia"> We're not talking about 
          a species or two. The key word here is <em>most</em>. The last of these 
          extinctions took place 65 million years ago and until recently was a 
          mystery to scholars. We now know that the Age of Reptiles, about 100 
          million years of earth time, came to a screeching halt when a massive 
          asteroid collided with the planet off the Yucatan coast of Mexico. This 
          earth shattering event led to tsunamis, fire storms, and cataclysmic 
          climate upheaval that selected for mammals over reptiles. T. rex never 
          had a chance. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">The sixth mass extinction 
          is currently in progress and is unique. It is the only one driven, not 
          by geology or astronomy, but by a single LIVING force-<em>Homo sapiens</em>! 
          The inescapable truth is astonishing. Through direct persecution or 
          habitat destruction humankind will bring about the demise of 25 to 50% 
          of planetary species in the current century, a geological millisecond. 
          We are the most awesome force for change the earth has ever known, greater 
          even than asteroids and volcanoes. We became this way mostly in the 
          last century through population growth and an acceleration of the technological 
          revolution. As a result we exponentially increased our power to burn, 
          cut, dig, move, and otherwise transform the physical earth. And that 
          has given us all the advantages of the modern world while at the same 
          time making us the most potent extinction force in 65 million years. 
          Maybe of all time. We are king of the mountain, for now.</font></p>

          on the earth. For better or worse, advanced technology is sweeping the 
          globe. (next photo)</font></p>
