        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">So 
          with the power of a president and new pro-conservation organizations 
          the bison and egret were snatched from the jaws of oblivion. They would 
          not suffer the fate of the passenger pigeon. It was a clarion call to 
          action. Species could be saved if only we cared. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          the first half of the 20th century environmental issues took a back 
          seat to a couple of wars and a great depression. Conservation legislation 
          barely trickled through Congress during these tough times. The post-war 
          years, however, were filled with an exuberant optimism. The United States 
          had won the &quot;greatest of all wars&quot; with new technologies and 
          would now convert these to peacetime applications, including space exploration, 
          computers, and wonder drugs. This fueled a swagger just waiting to happen 
          after years of war and depression. Babies were booming and so was the 
          national economy. It seemed nothing but good times were rolling.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          new problems lurked. The air in our northeastern cities had become thick 
          and hazy, irritating to eyes and lungs. Streetlights stayed on during 
          the day and freshly fallen snow was gray, or even black. These problems 
          were traced to the burning of fossil fuels, primarily coal and gasoline. 
          Public lands were threatened by rapaceous developers and parks were 
          overrun by hordes of littering tourists. Rivers and beaches were fouled 
          with oil, chemicals, sewage, and garbage, the scraps of man's daily 
          activities. A river in Cleveland caught fire from pollution. Songbirds 
          were disappearing from our backyards. And the national bird faced the 
          real possibility of going extinct. It was clear we were seriously contaminating 
          our environment. (next photo)</font></p>
