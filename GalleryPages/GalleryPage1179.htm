        <p align="center"><em><font size="4">Science is not only compatible with 
          spirituality, it is a profound source of spirituality.<br>
          Carl Sagan</font></em></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Disbelief 
          in science is alive and well today, having flourished since the Middle 
          Ages when Galileo was threatened for daring to assert that the earth 
          orbited the sun. This ran counter to the teachings of the church and 
          was, shall we say, frowned upon. Today, most people profess to believe 
          in the scientific method. But do they really? The problem is the evidence-based 
          method can lead us to truths that are less than self-evident and at 
          odds with our core beliefs. Then what do we do? We believe what is convenient 
          despite mountains of evidence to the contrary. And there's always a 
          mad scientist on the internet with &quot;proof&quot; that our beliefs, 
          no matter how ludicrous, represent truth. The media love to give attention 
          to these naysayers because it sells. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Just how 
          ludicrous can it get? Surf the web and you can find a cult of people 
          who are convinced the moon landings never happened. The entire space 
          program, the race with Russia, exhibits at the Smithsonian Air and Space 
          Museum? All a hoax. Alan Shepherd, John Glenn, and Neal Armstrong? Frauds.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In Portland, 
          Oregon, not generally known as a hotbed of conservatism, fluoridation 
          of the municipal water supply was voted down in 2013, and not for the 
          first time. The stated reason? Fluoride may be harmful to human health. 
          This assertion despite 60 years of use by most of the rest of the country, 
          without a single confirmed case of toxicity. Even the fist pounders 
          are mostly mum on this one. Science has shown that fluoride is a cheap, 
          safe, and effective way to hang on to your teeth. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And don't 
          even get me started on vaccines. Oh well, too late. One of the truly 
          great discoveries of all time, vaccines have changed the world for the 
          better. No other therapeutic intervention is more natural or logical. 
          No drugs. No surgery. No sorcery. Vaccines take advantage of our own 
          immune systems to add years, perhaps even decades, to life expectancy. 
          They have contributed enormously to our well being. Period. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Not so 
          long ago in the U.S. a newly conceived child had about a 50-50 shot 
          at making it to the age of five (it's still that way in parts of Africa, 
          Asia, and South America). Today a young child dying of anything will 
          make the front page of most small town newspapers. Thank you very much 
          modern world, including clean air and water, balanced nutrition, sanitation, 
          and high tech medicine, including vaccines. And by the way Jenny McCarthy, 
          there is not one shard of credible medical evidence, despite decades 
          of worldwide research, that vaccines cause autism. </font></p>

        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The science 
          of waterfowl management, part of the discipline of ecology, is responsible 
          for thriving populations of ducks and geese today. Many of our wildlife 
          refuges are dedicated to this mission. Much of the research is funded 
          by hunting groups such as Ducks Unlimited. (next photo)</font></p>
