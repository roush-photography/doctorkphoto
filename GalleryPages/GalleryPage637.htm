        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In Louisiana 
          <em>coast </em>is a rather nebulous term. Instead of an &quot;edge&quot;, 
          a clear line of demarcation between land and sea, it is a tangled web 
          of barrier islands, bays, marshes, estuaries, and freshwater swamps 
          running inland for miles and miles. This hodgepodge of ecosystems blends 
          to become the Louisiana wetlands, one of the richest wildlife areas 
          in the U.S., perhaps the world. Here great blue herons, Louisiana herons, 
          great and snowy egrets, roseate spoonbills, ducks, pelicans, gators, 
          muskrat, mink, and mocassins have thrived since time immemorial. And 
          as far as we know there are no Burmese pythons. At least for now. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          that's not all. About half of the shrimp and oyster harvest in the U.S. 
          is pulled from these rich waters. And nearly all of that, plus a fair 
          amount of fish and crab, comes from the marshes and bays of Barataria, 
          Timbalier, and Terrebonne. Without this wetland complex, bordered on 
          the west by the Atchafalaya River and the east by the Mississippi, these 
          fisheries would &quot;dry up.&quot; Without the grasses and reeds there 
          are no resident or migrating birds. And without these things there is 
          no south Louisiana cajun culture. Hard to imagine. What will the Boudreauxs 
          and Bergerons do?</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Louisiana 
          Highway 1 follows a meandering Bayou Lafourche, through Thibodaux, Galliano, 
          and the rest, all the way to Grand Isle. Here people are worried. They've 
          been dealt two knockout blows, oil and Katrina, in a single round. Can 
          they get back on their feet? Along the docks there is fear that the 
          oil will kill their livelihoods and taint their homeland for years to 
          come. Seafood markets are slow. No wonder. Locals and visitors alike 
          are scared. Of toluene, benzene, and whatever else. Shrimp signs are 
          crossed out and Crawfish scribbled instead. The mud bugs are not yet 
          threatened since they are farmed inland. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Some 
          say we should drill in the Arctic instead of the Gulf since there are 
          fewer people. However, the inevitable spill in these frigid waters would 
          recover, not in years, but epochs. If ever.</font></p>
