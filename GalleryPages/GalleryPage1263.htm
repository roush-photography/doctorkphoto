        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It's 
          late afternoon at Gombe Stream, on Lake Tanganyika in Tanzania. I am 
          with the chimpanzees of Gombe, the very ones that Jane Goodall lived 
          with and studied for years. I have followed them for several days, fascinated, 
          as she was, by their similarity to us. We are the closest of kin and 
          share more DNA (99.5%) than a zebra does with a horse. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          I stroll the beach alone as twilight approaches, in front of Jane's 
          now abandoned cottage, trying very hard to transport my mind back to 
          1960 when she began her groundbreaking work with the chimps at this 
          very spot. I am humbled by this great lady's awesome spirit as I gaze 
          out over the lake, at the African sunset. As the sky erupts in blazing 
          colors, I hear the distant clatter of an outboard engine, and soon the 
          motorboat putt-putts by, en route to parts unknown for a night of fishing.

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
          picture captures the mood and majesty of that evening. Goodall, a quiet 
          and passionate loner, would come to be known as National Geographic's 
          &quot;cover girl&quot;, the African queen, tolerating her celebrity 
          for the sake of Gombe's chimps.</font><font size="4" face="Georgia"> 
          She now sits atop a pyramid representing the world's foremost wildlife 
          conservationists, a lofty perch once held by French oceanographer Jacque 
          Cousteau. With his passing in the late nineties she took up the torch 
          and has carried it with grace, in every step she takes, speaking passionately 
          for her fellow creatures who cannot speak for themselves. To walk in 
          her footsteps in Tanzania was one of the great honors of my life. </font></p>
