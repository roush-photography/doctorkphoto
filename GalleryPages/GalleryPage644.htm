        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Koalas 
          are as Aussie as kangaroos and convicts, but Australia's arboreal ambassador 
          and lord of the limbs, is in trouble. Its habitat and diet, eucalyptus 
          trees, are falling fast along the east coast, formerly the koala's stronghold. 
          The contrary little pseudo bear, velcroed to a tree most of the day, 
          lives to sleep, yet people charge into action on his behalf. And most 
          experts agree that action is needed pronto. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Aboriginals 
          hunted koalas for thousands of years with minimal impact on their numbers. 
          Things would change, however, after Europeans arrived and felt of their 
          fur. They used cyanide for the indiscriminant slaughter of millions, 
          which, of course, meant none of those unsightly bullet holes to damage 
          the goods and lower profits. The last open season was in Queensland, 
          1927, when more than 600,000 koalas were harvested (or was it poisoned). 
          The carnage caused such an outcry that the Australian government finally 
          banned the export of koala fur. By then treetops in the state of South 
          Australia had already been stripped bare of the cuddly critters. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          ban on hunting helped for awhile, but then Aussies started doing more 
          of what people do best, which is making more people. Population growth 
          this century has led to clearing of eucalyptus forests for farms and 
          human settlement. Today koalas roam the canopies in disconnected stands 
          of only four states (out of seven) where they compete with people for 
          prime real estate. Guess who wins that contest. You got it. Koala numbers 
          take a dive. And unlike hunting which can simply be stopped, habitat 
          loss is irreversible. Humans seldom give back what they take. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          gloomiest experts claim koala numbers are as low as 40,000. Not endangered 
          yet, but the curve is headed lickety-split in that direction. The cry 
          throughout koaladom is that Australia would <em>never </em>let its international 
          heartthrob go extinct. Certainly koala power has mobilized an army of 
          worldwide concern into battle. Will it be enough? </font></p>
