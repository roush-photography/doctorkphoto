          Pope Francis</em></font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Disbelief 
          in science is alive and well today, flourishing since the Middle Ages 
          when Galileo was threatened for daring to assert that the earth orbited 
          the sun. This ran counter to the teachings of the church, which was, 
          shall we say, frowned upon in those days. And yet today most people 
          profess to believe in the scientific method. But do they? The problem 
          is the evidence based method can lead us to truths that conflict with 
          our core beliefs. Then what do we do? We believe what is convenient, 
          even when there is a mountain of evidence to the contrary. And there's 
          always a mad scientist or naysayer somewhere on the internet with &quot;proof&quot; 
          that our beliefs, no matter how ludicrous, represent truth. The media 
          love to give attention to these professional controversialists. It sells. 
          Just how absurd can an educated, middle-class American's beliefs be?</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Any internet 
          search engine can take you to a cult of people who are convinced the 
          moon landings were staged. The entire space program was and is a hoax. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In Portland, 
          Oregon, not generally known as a hotbed of conservatism, fluoridation 
          of the municipal water supply was recently voted down (2013). Again. 
          The stated reason-fluoride may be harmful to human health! This assertion 
          despite 60 years of use by most of the rest of the country without a 
          single confirmed case of toxicity. Even the fist pounders are mostly 
          mum on this one. The fact is fluoride is a cheap, safe, and effective 
          way to hang on to your teeth. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And don't 
          even get me started on vaccines. Oh well, too late. One of the truly 
          great discoveries of all time, medicine or whatever, vaccines have changed 
          the world for the better. No other therapeutic intervention is more 
          natural or logical. No drugs. No surgery. No sorcery. Vaccines take 
          advantage of our own immune systems to add years, perhaps even decades, 
          to life expectancy. They have contributed enormously to our well being. 
          All of this in the last century, a mere &quot;blink&quot; of human history. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Not so 
          long ago in the U.S. a newly conceived child had about a 50-50 shot 
          at making it to the age of five. About half of these deaths were pregnancy 
          related and the other half occurred after birth (don't quibble about 
          the exact percentages). Today a young child dying of anything will make 
          the front page of most small town newspapers. Thank you very much modern 
          world, including better nutrition and sanitation, and the introduction 
          of <em>vaccines</em>. Perhaps Jenny McCarthy should spend some time 
          with photos from the 1950s of polio patients on &quot;iron lungs.&quot; 
          Forever! Wards full of them. Or read the history of heart surgery, and 
          the efforts, often futile, to save the lives of &quot;rubella babies.&quot; 
          These viruses still lurk in the shadows. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And there 
          is not one shard of credible medical evidence, despite decades of worldwide 
          investigaion, that vaccines cause autism.</font></p>
