        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          clearing of natural vegetation for agriculture results in erosion of 
          topsoil, with billions of tons blowing in the wind or washing downriver 
          to the ocean each year. Iowa has lost 50% of its richest resource in 
          this manner. Overgrazing and intensive cultivation eventually lead to 
          declining yields and desertification, to the tune of 15 million acres 
          a year worldwide. And while fertilizers can increase yields, they, too, 
          eventually wash into rivers and wetlands where they fuel an algal bloom 
          that chokes out desirable species. In the seventies, the Potomic River 
          in the U.S. became nearly devoid of fish in this manner. Even with corrective 
          measures recovery has been slow.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There 
          are hundreds of known food plants in the world, yet most of humanity 
          depends on just three: corn, rice, and wheat. And only on a few varieties 
          of these, a disaster in the making. The switch from hunting-gathering 
          to farming traded a rich and varied diet for one that was plentiful 
          but less balanced in nutrients. Nevertheless, our species can reproduce 
          with a less than optimal diet. This much is clear. Agriculture provided 
          enough energy to fuel the great proliferation of our species, which 
          then spawned urbanization and the Industrial Revolution, with their 
          own sweeping environmental impacts. </font></p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          villages around Lake Sentani in New Guinea are refreshingly simple and 
          clean. Conspicuously absent are plastic bags, piles of garbage, and 
          crowds. The people fish, raise pigs, and harvest the sago palm for food. 
          They also have access to the markets of Jayapura where they purchase 
          other agricultural products, mainly sweet potatoes. (next photo)</font></p>
