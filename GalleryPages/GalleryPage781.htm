        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
          stuff our packs with gear and grub and ourselves into multiple layers, 
          then unzip the tent flap to greet the first moments of morning (translation-12:01 
          A.M.) with an unenthusiastic whine. Chad, our head guide, is looking 
          laudably perky, scarfing down eggs, cheese, and porridge with greedy 
          smackings. He is full of early morning happiness that is greeted by 
          looks of disapproval from his troops, none of whom has an appetite. 
          I force down coffee, two snickers, some raisins, and look for the Southern 
          Cross to conceal my nerves. The mountain is still out there, naked of 
          life and warmth and safety. At half past midnight some unknown force 
          launches us toward the summit of the Americas, and our dreams. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Like 
          pack mules we plod ponderously along, hopefully upward, laden by heavy 
          loads and breath, heads down, eyes fixed, a march of the dead. We see 
          nothing and hear only the cadence of rock under boot. One of my snickers 
          wants to come up for air but I will not allow it. Soon I am feeling 
          better. Not gladiatorial mind you, but pretty pumped up. My mantra is 
          &quot;It's only walking.&quot; All I have to do is put one foot in front 
          of the other. For 18 hours. Uphill. With 40% of the oxygen at sea level. 
          I follow Chad and his pumping testosterone, and try to draw on his strength. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
          stop occasionally, to rest and breathe and survey the craggy splendor. 
          It is a perfect day. Smaller mountains recede to infinity, spangled 
          with sunlight. We are at 21,000 feet. Only one peak towers over us now-Aconcagua-tallest 
          peak in the world outside the Himalayas. How hip can it get? (next photo)</font></p>
