        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Glorious 
          spring has arrived in North America. After spending the winter hunkered 
          down on evergreens in central Mexico and coastal California, monarch 
          butterflies are taking to the airways and heading north, as they have 
          for eons. Successive generations will relay across Mexico, the U.S., 
          and finally Canada by early autumn. In the process each generation completes 
          its life cycle (egg, larva, pupa, adult) in 40 days or so, then dies, 
          passing the baton to the next group of newly emerged adults, which then 
          flies further northward. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Then, 
          almost magically, fading light and chilling air announces the fall. 
          Leaves begin to turn, and every monarch butterfly does an about face 
          and heads south to flee the winter, fluttering thousands of miles to 
          roost in the same evergreen forests, often in the same trees, as their 
          ancestors. And here's the clincher-these butterflies are three to four 
          generations removed from those that departed Mexico and southern California 
          six months earlier. And that's not all. This lone generation is not 
          limited to a 40 day lifespan, and will survive, not only the southbound 
          flight of up to 3,000 miles, but six months of winter torpor, PLUS two 
          months of the return north. It is during this northward journey that 
          they mate to jump start the whole cycle again. Truly one of nature's 
          epic performances. And not a scientist anywhere has a clue how they 
          do it. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But everyone's 
          favorite insect is in serious trouble. Monarch butterfly populations 
          in eastern North America have plummeted by 90% in the past two decades, 
          from historical highs of one billion in 1995 to 30 million in 2014. 
          But this iconic butterfly's popularity just might save it. People are 
          taking notice, including those at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
          who are reviewing a petition to list the monarch as an endangered species. 
          And there's more. An unprecedented &quot;Tres Amigos&quot; summit convened 
          President Obama, Mexican President Nieto, and Canadian Prime Minister 
          Harper last year in Toluca, Mexico to consider the plight of the monarch 
          butterfly. The White House subsequently called a meeting of scientists 
          and conservationists to discuss declining pollinators, focusing on bees 
          and monarchs. Sixty groups, government and private, were represented 
          and charged with creating a federal strategy to deal with the crisis. 
          And U.S. Fish and Wildlife and the National Wildlife Federation signed 
          a historic agreement to collaborate on behalf of monarch butterfly conservation.
