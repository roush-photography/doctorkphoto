        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Compared 
          to Africa with its rich diversity of grazing animals, South America 
          is poor indeed. Ranging from the vast Patagonian steppe to the highlands 
          of Peru, the guanaco is the sole large wild herbivore. As such, this 
          200 pound <em>camelid</em> (like a camel) was vital to local Indians 
          in times past, supplying them with meat, wool, hides for shelter, sinew 
          for sewing, and images for their mythology. As with bison on the North 
          America prairie, the hunting activities of indigenous peoples had little 
          impact on the species' population. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Before 
          the arrival of Europeans guanacos roamed their range in numbers estimated 
          at tens of millions. Early explorers reported herds several thousand 
          strong in Tierra del Fuego and Patagonia. But that was then and sheep 
          are now. Although commercial hunting in the early 1900s began to take 
          a toll, the real death knell for the guanaco came with the establishment 
          of large sheep estancias (ranches) throughout Patagonia. Almost overnight 
          the king of the steppe had a serious competitor. Numbers plummeted to 
          perhaps 100 thousand, mostly clustered in protected areas at the continental 
          tip. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">So 
          the guanaco is now threatened thoughout much of Chile and Peru. High 
          profits from the fur trade, remoteness of the guanaco's range, and lack 
          of funds in these developing economies have hampered conservation efforts. 
          There is growing support for protection, however, as a new wildlife 
          awareness spreads around the world. And as ecotourism becomes increasingly 
          important in second and third world countries, there emerges a practical 
          reason to save wildlife. Species like the guanaco have begun to &quot;pay 
          rent&quot; on the space they occupy!</font></p>
