        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          the heartland of America bluestem and wild rye have been replaced by 
          cultivated wheat, making this region the breadbasket of the world, feeding 
          billions. Nevertheless, something has been lost in the process, perhaps 
          irretrievably, and that is the prairie, America's signature landscape. 
          The world's largest meadow, the &quot;big empty,&quot; has been reduced 
          to a few isolated reserves, tiny museums that represent less than one 
          percent of the prairie's former glory. Gone are waves of bluegrass blowing 
          in the wind, sweeping natural vistas, and priceless diversity.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">When 
          the early nineteenth century pioneers pushed westward, through evergreen 
          and hardwood forests, across the Appalachians and the Alleghenies, they 
          eventually came upon a landscape that flattened out and opened up for 
          a thousand miles. Here is where settlers truly encountered a &quot;new 
          world,&quot; different than the Europe of their past. It was a world 
          without trees, the unbroken blue and green, a wavy prairie drama that 
          did not end until it collided with the Rocky Mountains. They discovered 
          a culture of Plains Indians-Sioux, Cheyenne, et al-invigorated by the 
          Spanish horse and subsisting on buffalo herds nearly as thick as the 
          grass. The land was fertile and cheap. It seemed they had struck pay 
          dirt, a pot of soil so vast and rich it would feed the world forever. 
          That, of course, would not be the case.</font></p>
