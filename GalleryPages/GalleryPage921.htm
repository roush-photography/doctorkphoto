          Frederick Remington</font></em></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Electing 
          a progressive president is no guaranty of revolutionary change. Our 
          leaders are often motivated by noble ideals yet constrained by conservative 
          paradigms, designed to maintain the status quo in the absence of national 
          crisis. If it ain't broke don't fix it! It took a combination of World 
          War 2 and the Great Depression for Roosevelt to pull off the New Deal, 
          and the assasination of Kennedy to enact his programs of Civil Rights 
          and Medicare. What Clinton showed us, however, is that even in times 
          of peace and prosperity a progressive president can accomplish much 
          to enhance the national well-being. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          As an example the League of Conservation Voters rated Bill Clinton's 
          environmental record as one of the best of any president. He appointed 
          genuine environmentalists to head the Environmental Protection Agency 
          and the Department of Interior. And, as mentioned earlier, his Vice 
          President was one of the more eloquent spokespersons for the environment 
          of the late 20th century. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Clinton's 
          most visible achievement was to protect large parcels of land from exploitation. 
          He used the Antiquities Act of 1906 to declare millions of acres of 
          federal land as National Monuments, and therefore off-limits to development 
          or extraction (drilling, mining, and logging). These areas included 
          Utah's Grand Staircase-Escalante, Arizona's Grand Canyon-Parashant, 
          and California's Pinnacles. By doing so Clinton used the act to protect 
          more land from human plunder than did Teddy Roosevelt, the &quot;father 
          of conservation&quot; in this country.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">During 
          his tenure Clinton also used his executive power to declare nearly one-third 
          of national forest land off-limits to road building, logging, ranching, 
          and drilling. This lent protection to a whopping 58 million acres in 
          39 states, and included the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, which 
          was well on its way to being clear-cut of magnificent old-growth to 
          feed Japan's insatiable appetite for timber. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">These 
          represent significant achievements and assure that Clinton, along with 
          Carter and Roosevelt, will be long remembered for preserving America's 
          scenic landscapes and wild places. It was a great way to close out the 
          Century of Conservation!</font></p>
