        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In spite 
          of what you may have heard, the real story of Patagonia is not wind 
          or isolation, but the shifting fortunes of the sheep industry. Of all 
          the changes blowing through Patagonia in recent years, none will be 
          more telling than the shifts in ownership and land use of the great 
          sheep farms, or estancias, since the 1970s. That's when the bottom fell 
          out of wool prices even as much of Patagonia became desertified from 
          overgrazing. A culture and economy built on the back of sheep went belly 
          up. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1970 
          Santa Cruz Province had a thousand estancias, many of them several hundred 
          thousand acres just bleating with sheep. Today there may be half that 
          many, most of them owned by foreign investors, who are usually American. 
          And to make ends meet, they are turning to tourism, offering a Patagonia 
          style dude-ranch experience to subsidize income from wool. Wide open 
          spaces and drop dead vistas have made Patagonia a trendy new frontier-Colorado 
          at a discount.</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Driving 
          west across the Patagonian steppe, I chase the horizon straight to the 
          heart of the Andes, boasting the highest peaks in the world outside 
          the Himalayas. In doing so I pass several estancias, oases of green 
          accenting the sere brown bush. Arching over it all is a constant cobalt 
          sky. For a week I have fled the wind by day and gazed at the Southern 
          Cross at night. I am alone, better to commune with the inner self. The 
          solitude is occasionally punctuated by a lonesome gaucho, astride a 
          horse and rounding up strays, which in these parts would be sheep instead 
          of cows.</font></p>
