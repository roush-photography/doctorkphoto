          twin engine prop jet takes off from Fairbanks, on a foul day, with nine 
          passengers aboard. We're bound for Kaktovik, on Barter Island in the 
          Arctic Ocean, at the edge of the known universe. Getting anywhere in 
          Alaska is half the adventure, if not the fun. We have 400 miles of trackless 
          tundra and Brooks Range to fly over in roughly two hours, no pun intended. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I'm 
          settling in for a snooze when I notice out the window a total white-out. 
          I can't even see the wing tips, a few feet away. I know there are instruments 
          in the cockpit, but not having a sense of spatial orientation challenges 
          my composure. A short time later the engine slows, then misses, the 
          plane lurches a bit, and then banks as if trying to avoid something 
          big, perhaps a mountain or a building. We then fly for 30 seconds or 
          so, in more or less a straight line of continuous descent, still in 
          the white-out. I am pretty certain by now that we are all going to die. 
          And to prove it the ground makes an abrupt appearance, very close by. 
          The plane drops with a suddenness that makes hair stand up straight. 
          Then BANG. Contact! We bounce, then taxi down a runway that miraculously 
          is there. Like a gift from god. The sign says Yukon Flats. The pilot 
          says we have some mail to deliver (now he tells us). So much for my 
          snooze. Welcome to the outback of Alaska. (next photo)</font></p>
