          Georgia Island is a wild and romantic place, not dissimilar to Africa's 
          Eden, Ngorongoro Crater. Both are small in area with abundant and fearless 
          wildlife. South Georgia is a 100 mile long wilderness oasis in a world 
          mostly out of sync with nature. This outpost lies &quot;south of where 
          most ships sail,&quot; at latitude 54 degrees, a thousand miles from 
          Cape Horn or Elephant Island, take your pick. This explains why there 
          has never been a permanent human settlement here, only lonely whalers 
          and members of the British Antarctic Survey.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          typical island fantasy is a place of warm sun, bare skin, white sand, 
          and gentle surf. Add lovers strolling on the beach and you have a picture 
          post card. But not of South Georgia. Over half of this island is capped 
          by permanent snow and ice, with 150 glaciers spitting bergs and bits 
          into a frigid sea. The surrounding ocean is also littered with giant 
          tabular icebergs, each one a work of art, calved from Antarctica's ice 
          shelves. The island is as jagged as a dragon's spine, with more than 
          300 peaks rising like steep ramparts from the sea and jutting through 
          a mantle of ice, into a sky that's usually dark and brooding.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Most 
          of these peaks have not been named much less climbed, though a few have 
          been graced by the footsteps of Ernest Shackleton during his heroic 
          trek of 1916.</font></p>

          massive king penguin colony at St. Andrews, on South Georgia Island, 
          is one of the more impressive natural history sites on planet earth. 
          The fluffy brown chicks, called oakum boys, are forced to gather in 
          the muddy shallows around ponds and streams. Parents get the prime real 
          estate, high and dry, to lay their precious eggs. (next photo)</font></p>
