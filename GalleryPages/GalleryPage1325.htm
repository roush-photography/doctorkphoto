          Margaret Hungerford</font></em></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The elephant 
          seal is the &quot;Rodney Dangerfield&quot; of the ocean, garnering little 
          respect in human circles.<font face="Georgia"> Not so the great white 
          shark, fighter jet of the deep, or bottlenose dolphin, the brainchild. 
          And all acknowledge his highness the blue whale, grand leviathan of 
          the high seas. </font></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">But what about this grandest 
          of seals? Why no respect? Well, for starters, it's the comic physique. 
          The words <em>ponderous</em> and <em>homely</em> come to mind. Even 
          the elephant seal's trunk is just wrong, like it's been smashed. It's 
          the subject of jokes. Not so his African namesake. His is the right 
          trunk, a wonder of wonders. Why so?</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">It turns out to be a 
          problem of perspective. Through our eyes an elephant seal on a beach 
          looks totally out of place. No smooth curves or rippling sinew here. 
          Submerged, however, it's a different story. In his own element our seal 
          is not only the epitome of grace and agility, he's also a deep diver 
          and long- distance swimmer.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">After two months of turf 
          wars on rocky beaches around the world, during which time they mostly 
          fight and make up, the beachmasters and their harems slither into the 
          sea, where they spend the rest of the year. Once underwater, an almost 
          magical transformation takes place. These pinnipeds will venture halfway 
          round the world in pursuit of fish and squid, and dive a mile deep for 
          up to two hours. That's deeper than a submarine! They then surface to 
          breathe, recover in minutes, and dive again. And again. These feats 
          are made possible by large capacity lungs, an extraordinary blood volume, 
          and a shifty circulation. Thus plenty of oxygen is shunted just where 
          and when it is needed while the seal is holding its breath for hours. 
          So extraordinary are these seal-a-thons that scientists are attaching 
          devices to the beasts to gather data on climate change. So forget the 
          comic nose and physique, this superhero is helping to save the planet.</font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">This so called &quot;seal 
          diving reflex&quot; taught us a lesson or two about ourselves. The human 
          fetus spends nine months exposed to extremely low oxygen pressures, 
          low enough to kill an adult. And during labor it gets worse as each 
          uterine contraction decreases blood flow through the placenta. The fetus 
          survives just like the seal, with a large blood volume, and by preferentially 
          shunting blood flow to brain, heart, and adrenals, while limiting flow 
          to other organs that need less. </font></p>
