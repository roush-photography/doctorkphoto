          a third of Alaska lies above latitude 66 and is dominated by Arctic 
          tundra, one of the planet's major ecosystems. This is an area that was 
          little disturbed by man until the middle of the last century. It was 
          a mere 6,000 years ago that coastal Asiatic people followed the stepping-stones 
          of the Bering Land Bridge from Siberia into a realm they would call 
          Alyeska, and made a frail peace with this wild, unsettled land. They 
          migrated slowly eastward, across the north of Alaska and Canada, always 
          remaining a coastal people. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
          group would be called Eskimos, and later Inuit, not to be confused with 
          the <em>Indians</em>, who had arrived much earlier from Russia and spread 
          south, away from the coast. The Indians would people two continental 
          land masses thousands of years before any other humans arrived. They 
          developed many different cultures based on the varied mix of climate 
          and geography in the vast, untapped wilderness of the new world. But 
          the ways of the Eskimo were changeless across the top of the world, 
          with little margin for creative error in this unforgiving realm. They 
          harvested the fertile Arctic waters, hunted the tundra, and cultivated 
          their mythic reverence for nature. Humans, plants, and animals of the 
          region maintained a delicate balance not comprehended by people of today. 
          Impact on the environment was minimal. </font></p>

          in Kaktovik, and cargo planes several times per week, year round. Sometimes
