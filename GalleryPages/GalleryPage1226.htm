          To the Gulf Stream waters<br>
          This land was made for you and me<br>
          Woodie Guthrie</font></em></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
          is the primeval forest. Nothing can prepare you for it. No matter how 
          many times you read about it or see it in pictures, the giant redwood 
          forest will still take your breath away. Your mind will shut down, unable 
          to comprehend anything of this magnitude, and for several moments you 
          will stand there, lost for words and awestruck. You will wonder how 
          anything on earth could be so magnificent. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It 
          has been my good fortune to have gazed upon many of the world's great 
          panoramas-Grand Canyon, Machu Picchu, Iguazu Falls-and in my opinion, 
          the view and cathedral-like silence of a grove of giant redwoods compares 
          with any. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          coastal redwoods of Northern California grow within a few miles of the 
          world's largest ocean and spend much of their lives shrouded in fog 
          as a result. For the photographer this is mostly a good thing. It not 
          only adds a sense of mystery to the forest, but it softens the light 
          and reduces glare in the godbeams of this underworld. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          this is ridiculous! The fog is everywhere, threaded among the trees, 
          adrift on meadows, and rising like steam from the asphalt. It reminds 
          me of pea soup, so thick I can part it or play with it, which I am in 
          no mood to do. I feel damp and dispirited but take solace in knowing 
          that all fog must lift sometime, even this one. But when?</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          path is slippery from condensation, but the air feels clean, with a 
          chill. I shuffle cautiously forward, ever deeper into the gloomy silence. 
          The fog is getting thicker if that is possible, the world around me 
          erased. Visibility in this white soup is measured in inches. All I hear 
          are my own muffled footsteps and the sound of dewdrops falling like 
          light rain. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Finally, 
          a miracle in the dell. The fog parts ever so slightly from above, admitting 
          a golden beam through the canopy to reveal the surrounding woodlands. 
          And then it opens like a theatre curtain being drawn apart. I force 
          myself not to shout as I try to comprehend the surroundings. My eyes 
          are pulled upward, along the godbeams, and I see I am enveloped by the 
          world's tallest trees as they reach to the giddying heights of heaven. 
          I am agog at the scale of the place, uncertain where to place my gaze. 
          One thing I am very certain of, however, is that no other forest will 
          ever look quite the same again. </font></p>
