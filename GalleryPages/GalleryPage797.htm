          excessive breeding and abuse of the land mankind has backed itself into 
          an ecological trap. With a lopsided use of applied science it has been 
          living on a promissory note.&quot; Thus ranted William Vogt in <em>Road 
          to Survival</em>, in 1948, a generation before Rachel Carson would become 
          a household name. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">At 
          the beginning of the Sixties birds in midair occasionally fell out of 
          the sky. Literally dropped dead. At first no one had a clue. Then in 
          1962 came the bombshell. Rachel Carson's <em>Silent Spring</em></font> 
          <font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">was published 
          to public and critical acclaim and chemical industry brickbats. In her 
          book the shy scientist explained how toxic chemicals, the &quot;elixir 
          of death&quot; as she called them, moved through a food chain with disastrous 
          consequences. &quot;For the first time in the history of the world every 
          human being is in contact with dangerous chemicals,&quot; she wrote. 
          She might have added birds to the list. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And 
          she would preach, but to a Congress beholden to the chemical industry. 
          Even as she was pleading her case the U.S. was drowning in a chemical 
          quagmire that would one day lead to Love Canal and Times Beach et al. 
          From Agent Orange to defoliate Vietnam, to pesticides, fungicides, and 
          all the rest. Add weapons of mass destruction to the list and Vogt's 
          earlier prediction, that man was hell-bent to self-destruct, seemed 
          only obvious. </font></p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><em>Silent 
          Spring</em> is credited with launching the modern environmental movement 
          in the sixties. It recieved a lot of help from the agendas of Presidents 
          Kennedy and Johnson, and intensely negative reactions to Strontium 90, 
          Agent Orange, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and an oil spill in Santa Barbara 
          to name a few. Even Mickey Mouse gets some credit for persuading his 
          boss, Mr. Disney, to carry a picket sign in protest of pesticides. </font>
