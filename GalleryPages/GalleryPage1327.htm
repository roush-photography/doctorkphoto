          William Jefferson Clinton has been on the fast track all of his life, 
          always running for something. From early on it seemed to be his destiny 
          to journey from Hope, Arkansas to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and ultimately 
          environmental heroism. Perhaps it all began with that famous handshake 
          at the White House, in 1963, with his personal hero, President John 
          F. Kennedy. He was a junior at Hot Springs High School at the time.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          scholarly Clinton's quest would then take him to Georgetown University, 
          where he was class president his first and second years, and then on 
          to Oxford, in England, with a Rhodes Scholarship in hand. He then returned 
          to the U.S. and completed his formal education at Yale Law School. After 
          Yale, Clinton went back to his roots in Arkansas to enter politics. 
          He was elected governor at the spry young age of 32 and served five 
          terms. Twice he was elected chairman of the National Governor's Conference 
          for which he garnered much national attention. In 1992 he defeated the 
          incumbent President George H.W. Bush to fulfill his dream.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Clinton 
          began his presidency with a strong commitment to the environment. He 
          called climate change a global threat that required bold action. In 
          his first Earth Day address he promised to reduce carbon emissions to 
          1990 levels by the year 2000. This did not happen (and has still not 
          happened as of 2015). Clinton has received criticism within some environmental 
          circles for failure to achieve what, in retrospect, was the impossible. 
          But he would make up for this in other ways. (next photo) </font></p>
