        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
          humans are totally dependent on a healthy planet, and yet nature is 
          so generous that most of us live our lives without giving her a second 
          thought. At the most basic level all of our foodstuff comes from nature. 
          Only plants can manufacture food from &quot;raw materials.&quot; But 
          plants and animals throughout history have also provided man with clothing, 
          shelter, tools, fuel, timber, oils, dyes, and myriad other products. 
          And it is estimated that 25% of modern drugs are derived from plants 
          as are all high yield food crops responsible for the recent &quot;green 
          revolution.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          We have only just begun to tap the potential genetic and bioengineering 
          benefits that might be derived from even the most obscure of species, 
          few of which have been adequately studied. For example, the naked mole 
          rat of Africa, a blind, underground creature, recently discovered, that 
          lives the human equivalent of a thousand years. And <em>does not get 
          cancer</em>! We know little else about this amazing species. What other 
          secrets are rooting around in the African dirt?</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Nature 
          and biodiversity also exert a profound spiritual and aesthetic impact 
          on people, a benefit hard to put a dollar value on, so it is mostly 
          ignored in political circles. The presence of life animates our world 
          and enhances our emotional response to it. The complexity of the aesthetic 
          response is suggested by the variety of inspirations, from a mountain 
          stream in the Great Smokies to a forest of butterflies in Mexico. Or 
          simply gazing across the Grand Canyon of Arizona. These experiences 
          evoke intense feelings in people, of joy, even rapture and transcendence. 
          Such mystical events are among the most sought after by our species 
          and happen most often from the sudden insight that all things are one. 
          From such epiphanies came the enlightenment of Christ and Muhammad as 
          they wandered the desert, and Lord Buddha as he meditated under the 
          Bodhi tree. One final question-how much is enlightenment worth?</font></p>
