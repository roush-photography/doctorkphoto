      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There 
        is a widely held but mistaken notion that the 30,000 wild horses roaming 
        the American West are descendents of Spanish horses brought to the New 
        World in the 1500's. With a few notable exceptions, the truth is less 
        glamorous.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Today's 
        &quot;mustangs&quot; (from mestango-the stray) are mostly feral horses, 
        a mixture of breeds whose gene pools have been enhanced over time by occasional 
        input from released draft, thoroughbred, and Arabian stock. Most of these 
        deliberate releases occurred during the Great Depression. Genuine mustangs, 
        direct descendents of the Spanish horse, are found only in a few herds 
        of northern Wyoming. Nevertheless, nearly 500 years of natural selection 
        has given us a wild horse that can survive some of the toughest conditions 
        anywhere.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
        the mid 1800's around 40 million cattle were dumped onto the vast empty 
        of western United States. No surprise, the semiarid steppe of the region 
        soon became overgrazed. Even less of a surprise, local ranchers blamed 
        the damage on the few thousand &quot;exotic&quot; horses that had lived 
        there nicely for 300 years. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Of 
        course, the ranchers were wrong on both accounts. Their cattle stripped 
        the range bare and horses are not exotic to the Americas at all. The species 
        originated in North America some 55 million years ago and migrated thence 
        to the rest of the world. Although the Pleistocene temporarily vanquished 
        the horse from its native land, we can thank the Spanish Conquistadors 
        for correcting that mistake.<br>
