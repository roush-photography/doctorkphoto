          Joni Mitchell</em></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For 
          25 years I chased light and subject across 50 states, initially driven 
          more to explore and document than to save the world. Somewhere along 
          the way, an uneasy feeling began to nag at me as I witnessed first hand 
          the environmental issues that made headlines during the sixties. I became 
          increasingly aware of threats to wildlife and wild places from human 
          encroachment. Nature was under siege. I learned that we were in the 
          midst of the greatest extinction crisis the world had ever known, and 
          that the cause was human impact on our planet. I watched in dismay as 
          the wild edge of my neighborhood was replaced by urban sprawl, subdivisions 
          multiplying like cancer. These realizations tore at my heart even as 
          I continued to record the wonders that remained. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Consider 
          the changes in one lifetime. In 1948, the year I was born, Gatlinburg, 
          Tennessee was a backwoods hamlet that boasted a single retail outlet, 
          Ogle's General Store. Today the place is choked with sightseers, smog, 
          and shops selling souvenirs made in China. What's left of the former 
          hamlet is buried under a parking lot (Joni Mitchell was right..). All 
          of those cars spell bumper-to-bumper traffic, from downtown to the top 
          of Clingman's Dome. In the meantime, at Pigeon Forge, just down the 
          road a piece from Gatlinburg, things are worse! Thank you, Dollywood. 
          The traffic may not move for hours, and there are even more parking 
          lots. And the most shocking thing about all of this is that no one is 
          shocked about it. The hyperbole and oversell of the 21st century is 
          now the norm. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Inevitably, 
          the focus of my travels shifted from local to global, with an idea of 
          providing a window to the world through which others could share my 
          vision, and maybe even my concern. We live in a wondrous world, a spherical 
          garden teeming with life. Viewed from space, our planet sparkles like 
          a blue-and-white marble afloat in a barren universe. There are landscapes 
          of infinite variety and a treasure trove of wildlife that need protection. 
          Over time, I came to the conclusion that we must somehow find the will 
          to conserve a representative sampling of the earth's biodiversity before 
          it is too late-the conservationist's vision of Noah's ark. Many scientists 
          have stated that the minimum necessary is 15 percent of each ecosystem. 
          This is no less a goal than saving our planet. I decided to use my travel 
          photography to help make it happen. </font></p>
