        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">After 
          the mail drop the remainder of the flight to Kaktovik is anticlimactic. 
          It is mid-September, autumn in the far north. The sky is thick with 
          overcast which by now is spitting snow on this remote village of 200 
          Inuit. The locals are hunkering down for another long winter which is 
          how they spend about 75% percent of their lives. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Each 
          September an enduring ritual is played out on this half frozen stage. 
          Traditional whaling crews go out in open boats on a hunt that is sacred 
          to their culture. They will attempt to fill subsistence quotas established 
          by the U.S. or Canadian governments. For the village of Kaktovik the 
          quota is three bowhead (also known as &quot;right&quot;) whales. The 
          meat and blubber give the people protein and fat they need to survive 
          another Arctic winter. And the hunt strengthens ties to the past and 
          bonds within the Inuit community. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          hunt does something else. It has given rise to a fledgling tourist industry 
          on this godforsaken island. After the whales are butchered the carcasses 
          are dozed onto a lonely spit of land known affectionately as the <em>boneyard</em>. 
          Nearly a hundred polar bears are attracted to the area to scavenge this 
          bonanza. And in turn about a hundred visitors assemble for the season, 
          to view the bears and to soak up the minus five star luxury of the Waldo 
          Arms, Kaktovik's only hotel. Not exactly Disney, but it's a beginning.
