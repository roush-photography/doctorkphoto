        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">How could 
          this have happened? How can it be that these once thriving insects-the 
          key to one of the most fundamental, life-sustaining processes on earth-are 
          being driven toward oblivion? Some answers have emerged amid fierce 
          debate, for there is much at stake here, including the health of our 
          planet, and therefore us, and billions of dollars. How so? </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">One thing 
          is clear. We are dousing our country with agrochemicals produced by 
          giant companies like Bayer and Monsanto, including neonicotinoids, or 
          &quot;neonics.&quot; Prior to their release these companies undertook 
          multimillion dollar marketing campaigns to assure the public and all 
          parties concerned, such as the EPA and Congress no less, that their 
          chemicals were safe for humans and do not harm non-targeted species. 
          This dupe has been swallowed hook, line, and sinker. And the result-billions 
          of dollars in profit and no telling how many politicians in company 
          pockets.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But the 
          evidence shows otherwise. By volume neonics are 10,000 times more potent 
          than DDT. They attack an insect's central nervous systems causing paralysis 
          and death, including bees and other pollinators. And what complicates 
          the matter much further is that these are not surface insecticides that 
          wash off with a first rain. They absorb into the vascular system and 
          poison every part of the plant for extended periods of time, often years. 
          They linger in soil and wash into waterways in high concentrations. 
          A recent Dutch study showed 70% fewer invertebrates in water polluted 
          with neonics. And killing off mayflies and midges may have a domino 
          effect on birds that rely on them for food. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But the 
          most damning evidence came last June when an international task force 
          published an analysis of 800 peer-reviewed studies on neonics. They 
          found significant evidence of harm, not only to bees, but birds, wasps, 
          butterflies, beetles, worms, and fish. The report's leading author gave 
          this somber assessment: &quot;Far from enhancing our food production, 
          the use of neonics is threatening the very infrastructure that enables 
          it.&quot; One fourth generation beekeeper put it like this: &quot;The 
          farms that my bees service are now contaminated agri-deserts where only 
          row crops exist that are treated with chemicals all year long. We have 
          cast aside the value of conservation for biofuel.&quot; And perhaps 
          the most shocking report of all-numerous field studies have shown that 
          the use of neonics has done little to nothing to increase crop yields! 
          We are doing this harm for no good. Except for the agri-tech companies 
          and their pawns. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There 
          are many confounding variables in the bee story such as mites, viruses, 
          and loss of foraging habitat. But the bottom line is that until we turn 
          back the tidal wave of bee-killing pesticides unleashed in this country 
          in recent years, everything else will be just spinning our wheels. <br>
