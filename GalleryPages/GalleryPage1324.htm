          sewer.<br>
          Jacque Cousteau</em></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Around 
          the world oceans are a shell of their past. From the top of Greenland 
          to the abyssal bottom of Antarctica we are seining our seas empty of 
          fish. During the past 50 years populations of many commercially important 
          species have declined by half or more. Half of what we eat from the 
          sea today is farmed. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A recent 
          report on the size of the world's fishing armada is telling. Some 37,000 
          industrial sized fishing ships plus about a million smaller boats are 
          harvesting twice as many fish as just 25 years ago. Some trawlers are 
          as big as cruise ships and drag nets behind that can hold a dozen 747 
          jumbo jets.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Perhaps 
          the grimmest example of our plundering the seas took place off the coast 
          of Newfoundland. The Grand Banks were described by British explorer 
          John Cabot, in the late 1400s, as so bounteous with codfish that &quot;one 
          could walk across the ocean on their backs.&quot; And yet the world's 
          most prolific fishery was barren by 1992, a fishing moratorium declared. 
          As of 2016 that moratorium is still in place, with no recovery in sight. 
          So fish sticks are no longer cod, but whatever is left. The backbone 
          of the Newfoundland economy has crashed, perhaps for good. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the 
          1970s large numbers of a little known fish were found off the coast 
          of New Zealand. They were orange roughy and they were delicious. So 
          you can imagine the end to this story. Roughy were hauled out of the 
          ocean by the boatloads and shipped around the world. And then one day 
          a scientist reported some alarming findings. These fish were long lived, 
          up to 150 years, and slow maturing. They weren't up to the fishing pressure, 
          and soon they too were gone. A moratorium on orange roughy fishing is 
          currently in place in New Zealand, and as with cod elsewhere, there 
          is no recovery in sight. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And the 
          list goes on since there is money to be made and an exploding number 
          of mouths to feed. A few more examples: 1) Bluefin tuna, king of the 
          deep and prince of Japanese sushi, is in serious decline. 2) Pristine 
          reefs off Indonesia (some of the few remaining in the world) are being 
          poisoned by cyanide and blasted by dynamite to supply colorful hor d'oeuvres 
          to China's burgeoning middle class. 3) In New England it was once routine 
          to haul in lobsters weighing 20 pounds. Now it is rare to find one over 
          two. 4) An estimated 100 million sharks are caught annually to make 
          fin soup in China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. The dorsal fins are sliced 
          off and the shark tossed back in the ocean to die a slow death from 
          starvation. The nutritional value of shark fin is zilch and the soup's 
          flavor come from seasoning. You can buy a bowl for about $100. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Greedy 
          and ignorant seem a harsh indictment of the once noble fishing profession, 
          but what else is there in light of the facts? But is this picture inevitable 
          in a world bloated with hungry humans? Perhaps not. There are well managed 
          fisheries in Alaska and Iceland to serve as examples. And New Zealand, 
          much to their credit, learned a lesson from the roughy. As a result 
          of mandated &quot;No Fish&quot; zones many stocks are recovering (not 
          the slow growing roughy).</font></p>

          are Carmel, Monterey, San Francisco, and tens of thousands of rusted 
          drums offshore that are leaking, or one day will be leaking, radioactive 
          waste. </font></p>
