          thousand years ago the West was centered on the Mediterranean Sea, with 
          rudimentary trade routes to China, India, and sub-Saharan Africa. These 
          were, to be sure, roads less traveled, as post-Classical civilizations 
          were few and far between, out of reach to all but the most adventurous 
          of merchants. To the west of West lay the dreaded dark sea with mythical 
          monsters, and south, terra incognita, where men turned forever black. 
          Into this world, 200 years before Columbus, ventured Ibn Battuta, <em>Prince 
          of Travelers</em>. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Battuta 
          left Morocco in 1325 and set out for Mecca, &quot;intending to leave 
          all my friends and abandon my home as a bird does the nest.&quot; Armed 
          with an insatiable curiosity and the Koran, he would seek an elusive 
          horizon, through a world of Arabian Nights-endless caravans, veiled 
          harems, sailing dhows, and exotic souks. For three decades he would 
          wonder the far corners of the Muslim world and visit Mecca four times. 
          He logged 75,000 miles and 44 countries on today's atlas, three times 
          the distance of Marco Polo, and established himself as one of history's 
          great itinerants. All this while the Western world slumbered for 500 
          years after Leif Erikson discovered the New World. And then it was 1492.

          is still the epic journey to be made, to dream, to prepare, to set forth 
          as Jason with his band of Argonauts, in search of golden fleece. To 
          be tested by the gods and deemed worthy, to be blessed with a bit of 
          the truth to share with others. This then is the spirit of exploration, 
          as it has always been, and we are all explorers. </font></p>
