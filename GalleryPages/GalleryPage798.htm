          What is the use of a house if you haven't a healthy planet to put it 
          on?<br>
          Henry David Thoreau</em></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;Never 
          have a people spent so much money on so many expensive things as Americans 
          are doing today.&quot; With this simple but prophetic statement in the 
          1950's, Fortune Magazine proclaimed the modern era of consumerism. Later 
          Life, Look, and others followed suit, and advertised ad nauseum to fan 
          the &quot;material&quot; flames.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          postwar years witnessed other sweeping changes to our lives as well, 
          with booms in housing construction and road building. A new problem 
          called traffic congestion was making the news in our cities. It was 
          suggested that one day it might lead to traffic controls, or even &quot;stop&quot; 
          lights. The summer vacation became affordable for many Americans and 
          they sped in record numbers to our national parks. Federal agencies 
          engaged in massive reshaping of the land with dam building, wetland 
          drainage, and river dredging, which fueled the greatest economic growth 
          in world history. It seemed the more we conquered nature the richer 
          we got. A popular advertising slogan of the times was &quot;Progress 
          is our most important product.&quot; Indeed life in the USA was &quot;progress&quot; 
          in the fast lane. Boom, boom, boom.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          there was a catch to all this progress. Seems whenever we play we have 
          to pay, and in the 1950s we were playing with atomic bombs like they 
          were toys, &quot;testing&quot; (a nice word for exploding) in the Nevada 
          desert, on uninhabited South Pacific islands, and other places that 
          didn't matter much. Or so we thought. Come to find out we had riddled 
          the atmosphere with radioactive fallout that didn't vanish into thin 
          air after all. Rather it floated around the globe and settled, not just 
          over there, but here, in our own backyards. The experts seemed to have 
          overlooked this possibility. Oops. When Strontium 90 was found in cow's 
          milk, a staple in baby formulas, we began to talk test-ban treaty with 
          Russia. President Kennedy signed the treaty in 1962 and considered it 
          the high point of his presidency. That treaty is still in effect. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          concept of urban sprawl was &quot;invented&quot; in the postwar years 
          too, on the potato fields of Long Island, New York, of all places. Today 
          that potato field is Levittown, population 60,000!</font></p>
