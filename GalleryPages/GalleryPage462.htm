        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Often 
          referred to as the Amazon alternative, the lopsided Pantanal, at 80,000 
          square miles (think Utah), is one of the world's largest wetlands. Translated 
          from Portuguese roughly as the &quot;swamp,&quot; the Pantanal is really 
          an alluvial plain, flat as a flitter, so water meanders rather than 
          flows during the wet season. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Seasonal 
          rains arrive in November and, until March, inundate the Paraguay River 
          and tributaries. Thus begins &quot;the Full,&quot; when the Pantanal 
          is a mosaic of verdant lakes and tree-studded islands. Caimans, wading 
          birds, fish, and semi-aquatic animals such as tapirs and capybaras spread 
          out across the lagoons. Hydrophobes such as ocelot, jaguar, deer, and 
          cattle take to the high ground and try to stay dry. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Beginning 
          in April the waters recede ever so gently west, toward the Paraguay 
          River, and the land slowly begins to breathe again. A magical transformation 
          takes place as the Pantanal morphs from boot-sucking bog into tallgrass 
          prairie. Shrinking ponds become local bonanzas where wading birds feast 
          on marooned fish. When the fish run out the birds flee to nearby rivers 
          and streams. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          Pantanal would seem an improbable place for a cattle ranch, too wet 
          and too wild. And yet for more than a century a unique cattle culture 
          has evolved on giant ranches called <em>fazendas, </em>some a half million 
          acres in size, that double as wildlife refuges. This ranching style 
          is imposed by the extremes of wet and dry and protected by the relative 
          isolation of the region. But that may all be changing. (next photo)</font></p>
