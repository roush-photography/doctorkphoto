        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Across 
          the U.S. and around the world pollinators are in deep trouble, some 
          at risk of extinction. There is much talk and very little action over 
          this crisis. This is not a &quot;sweep under the rug&quot; issue we 
          can ignore until it goes away. How serious it it? Forests, wetlands, 
          prairies, croplands, and every other terrestrial habitat on the planet 
          depend on a healthy pollinator community to keep us and our animal friends 
          well fed and healthy. Globally about 85% of all flowering plants require 
          assistance from the birds and bees etc to produce seeds and fruit. Without 
          them the earth's biodiversity would plummet. There is evidence this 
          is already happening. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The players 
          in this high stakes game are well known. They include bats, hummingbirds, 
          songbirds, and other vertebrates. But the key players are small, the 
          spineless ones that buzz around our back yards. With a few exceptions 
          (butterflies) we call them bugs and like to zap them with poisonous 
          spray-honeybees, bumblebees, wasps, and others. Maybe we should rethink 
          the spray idea. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Agriculture 
          depends heavily on managed European honeybees. Colonies are trucked 
          from farm to farm like migrant workers to pollinate a hundred or so 
          commercial crops, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, and more. There 
          are about three million of these colonies in the U.S. alone and they 
          contribute more than $24 billion to our nation's economy each year. 
          There's an old saying that perhaps needs oft repeating in today's fast 
          paced citified world-you can thank a honeybee for one out of every three 
          bites you eat!</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It began 
          in 2006. Worker bees leaving the colony for a day on the farm and not 
          returning to the hive. The queen was abandoned by her subjects in this 
          &quot;rapture of the bees.&quot; Losses from 30-90% were reported by 
          beekeepers in the first few years of what came to be called <em>colony 
          collapse disorder</em>. Farmers flocked to Washington to tell lawmakers 
          of their plight. They predicted a tenfold increase in food prices if 
          the honeybee crisis persisted. What have our leaders done in the ten 
          years since this began? Absolutely nothing! (next photo)</font></p>
