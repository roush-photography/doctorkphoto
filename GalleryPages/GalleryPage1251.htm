        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I have 
          gathered with a group from the temperate zone, lower 48, USA. We are 
          in the rough-hewn frontier town of Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. This 
          is definitely <em>north</em>, as in latitude 66, the Arctic Circle. 
          It is Groundog day, but up here the groundhogs are AWOL! It's minus 
          30, wind chill minus 40. Spring? You've got to be kidding. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
          are here to experience the great outdoors, or &quot;Northern Studies 
          101&quot; as the group affectionately calls it. What was it really like 
          to be an Eskimo in the days of yore? We will build an igloo, go dog-sledding, 
          and look up in wonder at the Aurora Borealis. Home base is the Seaport 
          Motel, three squares per day and a cozy 72 degrees. Not exactly &quot;extreme<em>,&quot; 
          </em>but still roughing it for a wilderness warrior in the era of remote 
          control and drive-thru dining. </font><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          Better yet-room service, please. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          must confess that, in spite of my penchant for bed, breakfast, and climate 
          control, I am <em>s</em>trangely drawn to the outdoors, especially wide 
          open spaces. The mix of thrill and awe is a powerful concoction, like 
          a drug. I search for it everywhere. The feeling is &quot;kundalini,&quot; 
          weird shivers that travel up and down the spine in magical, mystical 
          moments. Goose bumps. For me it happens mostly in the grand cathedrals 
          of nature, especially when I'm alone. And what grander cathedral than 
          <font face="Georgia">a winter sky waltzing with color? </font></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">Three nights and no northern 
          lights. Churchill is blanketed in a rare winter fog, a white-out, visibility 
          zilch. Everything is at a standstill, especially the fog. The group 
          is ill-humored to put it mildly. This cannot be for real!</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">It's 9 P.M. and we bounce 
          out of town a final time in the tundra buggy to look for the fabled 
          lights. We are once again painstakingly wrapped in layers of puffy down. 
          No one is optimistic about the skies. It snowed all day. A half hour 
          later the buggy stops and we climb clumsily down the steps in our &quot;space 
          suit&quot; attire, like Neal Armstrong, circa 1969. Alas, finally, we 
          are greeted by a raven black sky with twinkling stars and planets. Already 
          there is a faint green arc bisecting the sky. And then the waltz, twirling 
          around the heavens, like a gift from God. The Aurora Borealis. Goose 
          bumps! </font></p>
