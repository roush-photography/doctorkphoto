          universe and human stupidity<br>
          And I'm not sure about the former<br>
          Albert Einstein</font></em></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;It 
          is clear that on environmental issues Ronald Reagan rode against the 
          American mainstream for eight years. The 'great communicator' was unable 
          to persuade Congress to repeal a single important environmental law. 
          He is the only president this century to serve his entire term with 
          no major conservation initiative.&quot; This powerful quote by Stewart 
          Udall, former Secretary of the Interior under President Kennedy, speaks 
          volumes about the environmental backlash of the eighties, engineered 
          by Ronald Reagan and his reactionary Interior Secretary, James Watt. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Secretary 
          would take the reins of office and lead a charge to increase logging, 
          drilling, and mining on public lands. This was shortly after proclaiming 
          to the nation that environmentalism was a &quot;left-wing cult,&quot; 
          perhaps his most infamous quote, but not his downfall. That would come 
          a short time later, after a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce when 
          Watt mocked affirmative action with the following statement about a 
          coal leasing panel: &quot;I have a black, a woman, two Jews, and a cripple. 
          And we have talent too.&quot; In one fell swoop the Secretary revealed 
          himself as the model of stupidity (and bigotry) Professor Einstein warned 
          us about! He subsequently resigned in disgrace. <em>Time </em>magazine 
          named him one of the ten worst cabinet appointees in history. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As if 
          James Watt wasn't enough to deal with, the decade of the eighties was 
          punctuated with truly catastrophic events. A congressional study of 
          1984 found that thousands of lakes and miles of streams in the northern 
          U.S. (as well as Europe and Asia) were nearly lifeless as a result of 
          acid rain. Airborne pollution from factories near and far was the culprit. 
          The same year a toxic leak at the Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India 
          resulted in the worst industrial disaster in history, killing 2,000 
          and injuring 200,000 people. A few years later the worst nuclear accident 
          in history occurred at Chernobyl, in the Ukraine. A half million residents 
          were relocated and as many workers were mobilized in a futile effort 
          to contain and clean up the damage. The cost in health is still being 
          calculated and the truth will never be known. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The first 
          tentative evidence of human related global warming was published in 
          the mid eighties, followed shortly by further evidence of an expanding 
          ozone hole over Antarctica. True to administration form Reagan's Energy 
          Secretary Donald Hodel suggested darker sunglasses and more sunscreen 
          as a solution to the problems. When the public relations backlash settled 
          from this absurdity the adminstration briefly came to its senses and 
          joined with 23 other nations in a phase-out of CFCs. </font></p>

        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Climate 
          change is obvious in Alaska as glaciers melt and temperatures rise. 
          In 2016 the humpback whales began their migration from Alaska to Hawaii 
          three months later than usual. One of the possible explanations is global 
          warming.</font></p>
