        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          Leakey was relentless. With unflagging enthusiuasm and larger-than-life 
          charisma, he mustered the support to send, not one, but three women 
          into the jungles of Africa and Asia, to do what had never been done. 
          They would live with the great apes, be accepted by their society, and 
          painstakingly observe and record their most intricate behaviors. It 
          would take years and impossible patience. Leakey was convinced that 
          only a <em>woman</em> could pull off such a feat.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">He 
          dispatched Jane Goodall to Gombe Stream, Tanzania in 1960; Dian Fossey 
          to Karisoke, Rwanda in 1967; and Birute Galdikas to Camp Leakey, Borneo 
          in 1971, to study chimps, gorillas, and orangutans respectively. None 
          of &quot;Leakey's Trimates,&quot; as they became known, had prior academic 
          training or experience in field biology. They were, therefore, untainted 
          by preconceptions. It was just the way he wanted it - three driven women 
          with blank slates.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          trimates would vindicate Leakey. All three obtained doctorates in primatology 
          from leading universities (Oxford, Colgate, and U.C.L.A.) and established 
          research stations that are still churning out data in 2015. This work 
          has been hailed as some of the most important in the history of Western 
          science, and as an aside has sparked a worldwide interest in the plight 
          of the great apes, all three endangered.</font></p>
