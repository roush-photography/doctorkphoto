        <p align="center"><em><font size="4">There are three stages in scientific 
          discovery. First, people deny that it is true,<br>
          then they deny that it is important, then they credit the wrong person.<br>
          Bill Bryson-&quot;A Short History of Nearly Everything&quot;</font></em></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
          are all guilty of bias, even the &quot;cold-blooded&quot; scientist. 
          It's only human. We tend to &quot;see&quot; only the evidence that confirms 
          what we already believe. The difference is that scientific data are 
          subjected to peer review and replication before acceptance as &quot;truth.&quot; 
          In contrast, the lay opinion, often based on internet searches and junk 
          science, is not subjected to scrutiny. We're free to believe what we 
          want. To complicate matters, scientific &quot;truth&quot; is often short 
          lived. Vitamin X is good for you today, bad for you tomorrow. This is 
          a source of constant consternation to the public, yet there is no shame 
          in changing one's mind if new data demand it. Uncertainty is inevitable 
          on the front lines of any search for truth, but science will ultimately 
          triumph.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Recently 
          the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of the United Nations, 
          consisting of hundreds of climate scientists from around the world, 
          released a fifth report in 25 years. In it they proclaimed, more emphatically 
          than ever, that global warming is a fact, and that man has contributed 
          substantially to it in the last half of the twentieth century by burning 
          fossil fuels. And yet, despite almost universal agreement by the experts 
          (95 percent), half of all Americans still proudly proclaim their disbelief 
          in either issue. This is significantly more than in other &quot;advanced&quot; 
          countries. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Much research 
          has been done in the past 25 years, most recently out of Yale University, 
          in an effort to explain why we are so good at &quot;burying our heads 
          in the sand.&quot; Simplistically, it seems we fall into one of two 
          tribes: one that believes industry often behaves badly and must be regulated 
          by government, and another believes government is the problem and should 
          stop meddling in private affairs. No matter which tribe we belong to, 
          we want very badly to be accepted. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">So it 
          would seem that peer pressure does not fade with high school graduation 
          at all. It is alive and well at the club, at church, in local bars, 
          and on the golf course. To remain in the graces of our group we will 
          turn a blind eye to science if necessary, especially when it doesn't 
          appear to cause any immediate harm. So we say no to climate change because 
          the urgency is hard to grasp, the effects not immediately apparent. 
          We can even change our minds later if we need to. (next photo)</font></p>
