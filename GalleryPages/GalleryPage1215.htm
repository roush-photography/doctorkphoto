          You say that the war is all done<br>
          Go tell it to those with the wind in their nose<br>
          Who run from the sound of the gun.<br>
          John Denver</font></em></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Imagine 
          Connecticut as a vast tree studded grassland, vibrating with the beat 
          of a million hooves and the thunder of predatory growls, and the scale 
          of the Serengeti Plains will come into focus. Grand in scope, like Yellowstone, 
          a fair comparison. As one of the world's most iconic travel destinations, 
          the Serengeti receives more funding than other parks in poor countries. 
          Much of this, however, comes from without, via organizations such as 
          World Wildlife Fund, and many others.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          funds pale in comparison to need. This is a big place under constant 
          threat, primarily from poaching. A chief warden commands an army of 
          rangers, military style. Bases are dispersed throughout the enormous 
          system. However, tents, food, arms, and ammunition are often in short 
          supply. Rangers risk their lives on a regular basis for $100 a month, 
          that may come late, or not at all.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          park's few small planes are often in disrepair and maintenance is unreliable. 
          And when the planes are finally airworthy they may be grounded by lack 
          of fuel. Vehicles, in constant use on bumpy track and through the bush, 
          have a short life expectancy, and Tanzania often lacks the funds to 
          repair or replace them. The same is true for shortwave radios, critical 
          for coordinating efforts in a park this size.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">On 
          the other hand the enemy is well trained and well supplied, with aircraft, 
          automatic weapons, and plenty of ammunition. Outlying park stations 
          are strategically attacked by commandos, often with fatalities, which 
          leads to low morale of the outmanned park rangers. Driven by huge profits 
          the professional poacher will hunt by night and hide by day, far from 
          roads, invisible from the air, and flanked by soldiers who are paid 
          well and on time.</font></p>
