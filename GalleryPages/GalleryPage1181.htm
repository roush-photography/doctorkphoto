        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The lexicon 
          of photography suggests the power of its influence upon our world. We 
          shoot photos, freeze motion, and capture memories. The photographer 
          seizes from a split second a subject that remains fixed even as time 
          marches on. In the early days people were afraid of the camera, that 
          it might steal the soul on its way to heaven. Few feel this way today, 
          and it's a good thing. Millions carry cameras with them everywhere they 
          go, shooting everyone and everything they meet. Billions of photos have 
          been uploaded to Facebook alone, not to mention other online sharing 
          sites. We post, tweet, and even occasionally print photos, creating 
          a record of our world unimagined a few decades ago. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          an indirect way this book is my memoir, in pictures and stories. When 
          I first picked up a camera at age 19, I had no idea of the role it was 
          destined to play in my life. It was an enjoyable hobby, but quite possibly 
          frivolous. To my surprise it evolved into the perfect means for me to 
          express growing concerns I had about the world we live in.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For 
          many years I have pursued a passion I never imagined in those early 
          days. I have tracked mountain gorillas in the cloud forest of Rwanda, 
          been charged by a tiger in India, and sat humbly in the presence of 
          a panda in China. In each case I have felt a profound connection to 
          the miracle of life and the only place it thrives: planet Earth.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          their world is ours too, for which we bear the ultimate responsibility. 
          If we are to live up to our great promise as a species-the heirs to 
          Gandhi and Shakespeare-it will be because we have been careful stewards 
          of this planet. The purpose of my photography is to spread this message.</font></p>

          River on an eight day river run through the Grand Canyon. The canyon 
          is my favorite place in the world. I have never seen anything half as 
          beautiful, and have been there many times. </font></p>
