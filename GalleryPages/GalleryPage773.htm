          Japanese consider the tancho, or red crown crane, a national treasure, 
          revered as a symbol of longevity, good luck, and happiness. Historically 
          the crane has been a part of legend and folklore. Today the Japanese 
          paint and take pictures of it, carve it into statues, and pen it into 
          poems. They imitate the grace of its dance, and name cities, streets, 
          and parks after it. They hang the tancho as colored ornaments in temples, 
          shrines, and on stone monuments to Hiroshima in Peace Memorial Park. 
          Scientists study its behavior through banding in a feeble attempt to 
          understand it. Farmers feed it in the winter in a feeble attempt to 
          save it. And they have killed and eaten it to near extinction. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Sadly 
          the tancho in Japan is mostly an icon today. Ironically this endangered 
          bird's image is seen everywhere-on teacups, fans, kimonos, jets, et 
          al-as a symbol, and almost nowhere in the wild. Its range in Japan is 
          limited to a few small reserves on the remote island of Hokkaido. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          story of the red crowned crane in Japan is the same for many other species. 
          The nation's reverence for animals is ancient, but efforts to protect 
          them are very new, and a gesture at most. Since the mid 20th century 
          nearly 200 species, including the red crowned crane, have been designated 
          as &quot;national monuments.&quot; They are thus protected by laws which 
          prohibit their harm <em>unless there is a conflict with human enterprise</em>. 
          There's always a catch! (next photo)</font></p>
