      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
        awake on my first morning in Delhi, bright-eyed, eager to see it all. 
        My step is filled with a certain springiness as I saunter out the Imperial 
        Hotel and onto the streets for a pre-dawn stroll. The nearest thing to 
        peace in downtown Delhi takes place at this hour, in the dim light of 
        awakening dawn, when even the most ardent debauchers are still at roost. 
        And not just in the slums. I ponder the eerie quiet as I step over a few 
        of the city's many homeless who have made their nest this night in the 
        fashionable hotel district. Bodies lay like flotsam in doorways, under 
        poster-plastered trees, and in gutters. Somehow it all seems rather natural.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">My 
        first nasal sensation is of the musty smell of decay blended with that 
        of sewage. It is a smell that I will become semi-accustomed to, not by 
        choice. There is no escaping it in India. The smell will follow me everywhere 
        I go, infiltrating my skin, nose, and personal belongings. It will even 
        follow me home and visit for awhile. A special memory!</font></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
        took more people pictures in India than anywhere I'd ever been. There 
        are simply no stereotypes here. Everyone looks made up to a westerner, 
        like Holloween, and worthy of a photo. This mosque was my first visit 
        to the world of Islam and I wanted to make sure I behaved in an appropriate 
        way. As it turned out Muslims were pretty much like everyone else. They 
        didn't really seem to care what I was doing as they got on with their 
        daily lives. <br>
