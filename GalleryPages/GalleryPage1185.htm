        <p align="center"><em><font size="4">The Vietnam War was arguably the 
          most traumatic experience for the United States in the twentieth century. 
          That is indeed a grim distinction in a span that included two world 
          wars, the assassinations of two presidents and the resignation of another, 
          the Great Depression, the Cold War, and racial unrest. <br>
          Donald Goldstein-&quot;The Vietnam War&quot;</font></em></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Photography 
          has been called every man's art form. The power of photography to influence 
          opinion has been understood for a long time, dating back to before the 
          Civil War. And no genre of photography has done it better than photojournalism, 
          especially in turbulent times.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
          was never more apparent than during the Vietnam War. Three images from 
          that war were emblazoned in the consciousness of the world during the 
          sixties and seventies, and helped bring the controversial conflict to 
          a halt. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          1963 the Catholic regime of President Diem of South Vietnam was repressive 
          to Buddhists, who comprised a majority of the country's population. 
          In protest, Quang Duc, a Buddhist monk, drove his Austin from the Imperial 
          City of Hue to a busy intersection in Saigon, the capital. He then got 
          out the vehicle and assumed a lotus position in the heavy traffic. A 
          fellow monk doused him with gasoline, whereupon Duc struck a match to 
          himself. His burning image was flashed around the world. In response, 
          President Kennedy withdrew support for Diem, who was then assassinated 
          as his government toppled.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Tension 
          mounted as the surprise Tet Offensive began in 1968. Saigon's police 
          chief, Ngoc Loan, was on alert to keep Viet Cong guerrillas out of the 
          city. Loan executed Van Lam, a prisoner, in front of An Quang Pagoda 
          as photographer Eddie Adams snapped a Pulitzer Prize winning photo. 
          This image helped to turn the tide of public opinion against the war, 
          not just in the United States, but around the world. Loan claimed Van 
          Lam had killed Americans and Vietnamese, while others argued that he 
          was just a foot soldier, following orders, who did not deserve to be 
          executed. (next photo)</font></p>
