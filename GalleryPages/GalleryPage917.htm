        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Malaysia 
          has one of the most ethnically diverse populations on earth. There are 
          two underlying reasons for this. First, this California sized peninsula 
          sticks out from the Asian continent like a sore thumb, into ancient 
          shipping lanes between East and West, or, if you will, Europe, and oriental 
          silk and spice. Malaysia was a convenient congregating point where these 
          widely divergent cultures met and traded their wares, exchanged ideas, 
          and, quite naturally, their genes. The result was a &quot;melting pot.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">To 
          understand the second reason for this astounding diversity one must 
          hearken back to the colonial period of the 1800s. That's when the face 
          of Malaysia changed forever as a British colony. Forests were cleared 
          and the timber shipped to the mother country, which was out of trees 
          by this time in her history. And two massive industries, tin mining 
          and rubber, were started because England needed them too, and the king 
          and queen didn't want to get their country dirty. And for this work 
          the always cunning Brits imported foreign labor. They brought in Chinese 
          coolies to work the tin mines and Indians for the dreary rubber toil. 
          And like timber, tin and rubber were also shipped to England. After 
          all, what were colonies for but to make sure the king and queen, halfway 
          around the world, had all the tin and rubber they needed?</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">By 
          the 1900s the Malay represented 50% of Malaysian people, Chinese 30%, 
          Indians 8%, and a hodge-podge the rest. The Chinese were mainly Buddhists 
          who spoke Mandarin, while the Indians were Hindu who spoke Tamil, from 
          southern India. The British knew well the principle of divide and conquer. 
          By hardening the lines between the majority Malays and the Chinese and 
          Indians they effectively secured their own power. The Malaysian polyglot 
          was not likely to present a united front on anything, and the Brits 
          knew it. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          1957, during the anticolonial movement that swept the world, Malaysia 
          gained its independence from England. It would be a shaky start, as 
          would be the case for most of the fledgling nations of that era. Long-standing 
          resentments eventually boiled over in 1969, into racial violence and 
          ultimately civil war<font face="Georgia">. Parliament and the constitution 
          were suspended. Finally in 1971 the voices of reason spoke out and healing 
          began. (next photo)</font></font></p>
