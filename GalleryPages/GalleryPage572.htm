        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Like 
          many of the world's charismatic megavertebrates (whale, elephant, lion, 
          tiger), the sea turtle is in a race for survival. Once so abundant that 
          Columbus described the Caribbean as a &quot;sea of floating rocks,&quot; 
          all eight species are now threatened or endangered. There is one, and 
          only one, reason for this predicament-man's plundering of the oceans.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          sea turtle's dilemma demonstrates just how awesome is man's dominion 
          over the earth. Some turtle species live in shallow water where he trolls 
          his clingy and ubiquitous nets. They don't have a chance. But even deep 
          water species are not out of harm's way. Turtles must periodically surface 
          for air and all too often they encounter something human along the way. 
          It's those nets again. Other species are pelagic, or open ocean, which 
          would seem pretty safe. Right? Yet females must come to shore one night 
          a year to lay their eggs. Guess who's waiting for them.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For 
          the sea turtle life begins tough and gets tougher. Nesting beaches are 
          buried under condominiums. Man eats the eggs as a delicacy and as an 
          aphrodesiac (just what our species needs). Hatchlings are gulped down 
          like hors d' oeuvres by birds and other assorted beasts. And the occasional 
          turtle that survives to adulthood swims daily through an obstacle course 
          of dangers, mostly man-made, and mostly nets.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          plight of the sea turtle has not gone unnoticed. Concerned citizens 
          around the world now feverishly protect turtles and their nests. Turtle-watching 
          ecotourism is promoted as are alternatives to turtle protein. Such efforts 
          will be necessary if this gentle giant is to survive into the 21st century.</font></p>
