        <p align="center"><em><font size="4">The biggest problem confronting the 
          environmental activist is the power of money.<br>
          Jane Goodall</font></em></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In a pure 
          free market economy, demand-not the wise and benevolent leader(s)-determines 
          what will be exchanged. Goods and services are offered in a market that 
          is free from government interference. The market is self-regulated by 
          competition and the law of supply and demand. If supply is less than 
          demand prices naturally rise, whereas if there is an oversupply, prices 
          fall. The whole system is private and driven by the desire of people 
          to acquire personal wealth. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In practice, 
          both centrally planned and free market economies have many flaws, and 
          there is not a pure form of either system anywhere. The developed countries 
          all utilize free market economies, but government regulation occurs 
          on many fronts, more so in some of the &quot;social democracies&quot; 
          of Western Europe. This might consist of adjusting interest rates, lowering 
          taxes, or increased government spending to stimulate a sluggish economy. 
          Both systems have been widely criticized for lacking a &quot;conscience,&quot; 
          by government in the case of socialism and by big business in the case 
          of capitalism. The outcome is the same: exploitation of the working 
          class in the ruthless pursuit of personal wealth by those in power, 
          the so-called class struggle. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Human 
          societies and their economic activities often do great harm to the environment, 
          and that has a direct impact on human welfare, immediately and in the 
          future. The effects of pollution and misuse of resources can be clearly 
          seen in developing countries, where little in the way of environmental 
          public policy is in place. Widespread disease and death can be directly 
          traced to degraded environments. The cost to human welfare is felt not 
          only in the area of health, but in economic productivity and social 
          stability. Laws to protect the environment are not luxuries to be tolerated 
          only if they don't interfere with economic growth. They are a keystone 
          in the foundation of organized human society. </font></p>

        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Bhutan 
          is a Buddhist monarchy widely acclaimed as one of the more &quot;enlightened&quot; 
          countries of our time. Rather strange kudos for a tiny, poor, and globally 
          insignificant nation that most outsiders have never heard of. There 
          are, in fact, many reasons for this unexpected recognition. To list 
          a few: 1) National success is measured by GDH, or gross domestic happiness, 
          not by economic growth as elsewhere. 2) Smoking was recently banned, 
          the only country to do so. 3) All agriculture is organic by law. 4) 
          Bhutan's carbon footprint is nil. 5) According to the International 
          Union For Conservation of Nature Bhutan is a role model for proactive 
          conservation. Nearly 60 percent of the country is protected in preserves. 
          The next closest is Costa Rica at 25 percent (the U.S. is about 6 percent). 
          6) The United Nations calls Bhutan an inspiration for how countries 
          and economies can address climate change and still improve the lives 
          of their people. (next photo)</font></p>
