        along by swift waters. To drift like pilgrims through a hushed cathedral. 
        To witness a gash in the earth beyond comprehension. To read a colossal 
        text of earth's history. To repeat Major Powell's journey into the &quot;Great

        Marie, our gorgeous and intrepid river guide, takes a plunge into the 
        cool pool at Elves Chasm of Grand Canyon. The eight day, 277 mile Colorado 
        River rafting trip through the canyon included many side trips to spice 
        up the adventure. This was one of them. Precious rain percolates through 
        the various limestone layers that constitute the canyon's aquifers, and 
        then surfaces as springs or waterfalls. Perhaps the most famous falls 
        are at Havasu, a world-class photography and hiking destination, but there 
        are many others offering a refreshing break from the desert heat. The 
        water at Elves Chasm is a cool, clear 50 degrees.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There 
        were two pontoon boats on this &quot;5 star&quot; river cruise, each with 
        a head guide and an assistant. The head guides were female and their assistants 
        were male. Talk about a change in social paradigms!<br>
