        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">What 
          does the future hold for the Gulf states after Deepwater Horizon? Is 
          full recovery possible? The truth is we don't really know. The answer 
          would seem to be a definite maybe, though it will be a slow, painful 
          process. The road to recovery may be glimpsed, perhaps, by looking at 
          Ixtoc, in the Gulf of Campeche off the coast of Mexico, the second largest 
          spill in history at four million barrels. This took place in 1979.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Local 
          reefs around Veracruz are still showing effects, 35 years later. On 
          the lagoon side the reef is gray and dead, and the sea floor is lithified 
          (turned into stone) oil, like some new geological novelty. On the ocean 
          side it's a different story. There wave energy, oxygen, sunlight, and 
          the Gulf's oil digesting bacteria cleared most <em>visible</em> evidence 
          of the spill in a comparatively short time, years, not decades. The 
          lesson for the Gulf states, and the world for that matter, is fairly 
          clear. When oil is entrapped in low oxygen sediments, as in a quiet 
          lagoon or a marsh, or on the deep ocean bottom, it can hang around indefinitely. 
          The real consequences of this may never be known, but they can't be 
          good, or even neutral, which leaves only one conclusion.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">So 
          what about fisheries? The 1978 Amoco Cadiz spill may shed some light 
          on this. Even in the turbulent, highly oxygenated waters off the coast 
          of France, where this spill occurred, it took seven years for the marine 
          life and oyster farms to recover. Things in Mexico weren't so good. 
          Ixtoc devastated local fisheries. Populations of fish, shrimp, conch, 
          and oysters were completely wiped out. In a split second fishermen were 
          unemployed, indefinitely, their future as murky as raw crude. Most gave 
          up and found new work after being hungry long enough. For many families 
          a long tradition of fishing came to a sad end. What about the few who 
          stuck it out? It was 20 years before catches returned to normal. (next
