        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          have just returned to earth with eight other climbers after standing 
          on the summit of Kilimanjaro, a 25 year dream come true for me. We are 
          ready to celebrate with beers and lots of real food. The hard part is 
          over and we will reward our efforts with another dream adventure, a 
          safari in Ngorongoro Crater, the &quot;Eden of Africa.&quot; </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          first we assemble after dinner with our guides, for a &quot;pep talk.&quot; 
          They advise us that the drive to the crater will be a bit bumpy, and 
          long, through primeval country pregnant with savage beasts and venomous 
          snakes. They suggest we celebrate less and sleep more. And we, of course, 
          smirk. Big deal. We just climbed to the roof of Africa!</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          am up before daybreak and watch as a pale dawn exposes the surrounding 
          landscape, a stark and seemingly endless expanse of rolling hills, cobbled 
          with rock and sliced by rut. I look for a road and there is none. Between 
          here and there are 100 miles of off-road! Yesterday's counsel begins 
          to sink in. The sun, nevertheless, smiles with promise, and I am off 
          to the jeep with a spring in my step.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And 
          so it is that we assemble for the day's land cruise, nine self-satisfied 
          summiteers, eager for a safari. But first, 12 hours on four wheels, 
          equipped with engine, shocks, and seat cushions. The works! How hard 
          can this be? We climb aboard with visions of a long nap. &quot;Wake 
          us when we get there.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          From the first grinding of low gear it is apparent our guides spoke 
          the truth. This will be an endurance test of mind and body, a succession 
          of axle wrenching obstacles. And so it goes-falling, flying, tumbling 
          in a stumbling jeep, for hour after endless hour. And we, in our private 
          worlds of weariness, woe, nausea, and vertigo, have but one synchronized 
          thought, &quot;Are we there yet?&quot; </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          last half hour of this everlasting day is a slow but eneventful ascent 
          to the rim of Ngorongoro Crater, over a primitive but most welcome road. 
          Finally, we crawl out the vehicles, wild-eyed and wobbly, pale, and 
          streaked about the face with rivulets of sweat. There is a strange feeling 
          of betrayal despite the warnings. We speculate on what has been damaged 
          most, flesh or ego. We are already discussing the return trip. After 
          all, how hard can a hundred mile <em>walk </em>be?</font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">After 
          a few game drives on relatively smooth safari track our agitated nerves 
          have calmed, so we pay a visit to this Masai village. Tall, stately 
          shepherds, the Masai are struggling to hold on to their traditional 
          way of life despite a rapidly advancing modern world. </font></p>
