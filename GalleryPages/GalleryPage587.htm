        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          black rhino was, until recently, the most numerous of its species in 
          Africa. Unrestrained poaching, reminiscent of the bison experience on 
          America's prairie, has led to a virtual collapse of the species. Before 
          European explorers and their guns penetrated darkest Africa, a brief 
          two centuries ago, there were an estimated one million black rhino south 
          of the Sahara. By 1970 their numbers had crashed to 70,000. Shocking 
          enough, yet today only 3,000 or so survive, under armed guard and behind 
          electric fences. Fifty million years of history may soon come to a screeching 
          halt, the snuffle of the great gray ghost silenced. From superbeast 
          to mythological unicorn<em>, </em>right before our eyes. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thanks 
          to a massive global effort the population of white rhinos is holding 
          steady at about 15,000, mostly in South Africa. Though this is encouraging 
          the species is still highly endangered. And the threat of poaching is 
          ever present. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Though 
          massive and powerful, the rhino is, nevertheless, at the mercy of man 
          and his greed and self-importance. And the diabolical cast is international. 
          According to official records, oil rich North Yemen imported 22 tons 
          of rhino horn in the 1970's and 80's, killing 8000 animals in the process. 
          The horns were used to make highly polished handles for <em>jambiyyas</em>, 
          the traditional curved dagger that is a symbol of status and wealth 
          in this tiny, globally insignificant, nation. With relentless pressure 
          from other nations North Yemen finally outlawed the importation of rhino 
          horn and is much less a threat to the species.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And 
          the same can be said of Japan and South Korea. Until recently these 
          Asian powerhouses imported large quanitities of rhino horn for use in 
          traditional medicine. Once again global pressure was successful in bringing 
          this practice to a halt, with both countries now banning import. The 
          importation of rhino horn was also recently banned in China though there 
          is still a black market.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          the last decade Vietnam, an emerging economic power with an expanding 
          affluent class, has become the major importer of rhino. The horn is 
          increasingly used as a status symbol by the wealthy, in business dealings 
          and social gatherings. The horn is ground to a powder, mixed with water 
          and sipped like a cocktail, merely for show. This frivolous behavior 
          was responsible for the slaughter of over a thousand white rhino in 
          South Africa in 2014. The horns now sell for $50,000 per kilo. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          Overall illegal wildlife trafficking generates more than 20 billion 
          dollars per year, ranking it alongside illegal drugs, guns, and human 
          trafficking as the world's top criminal activities. </font></p>
