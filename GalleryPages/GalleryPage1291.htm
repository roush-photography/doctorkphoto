          Robert Frost</font></em></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Stretching 
          around the equatorial girth of the planet in a broad green belt are 
          the earth's tropical rain forests, nine million square miles of what 
          certainly must be original creation. The greatest assemblage of biodiversity 
          anywhere. Nearly half of all known terrestrial species are found in 
          this impenetrable jungle, and there are millions more gene pools just 
          waiting to be discovered there.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">No 
          place in the world has spawned more legend, amplified recently by the 
          internet, than the &quot;jungle.&quot; We've all heard of the flesh 
          eating piranha. But rivaling the piranha for title of most fearsome 
          jungle creature is candiru, the tiny &quot;catfish from hell.&quot; 
          For 200 years tales have been told of this skinny vampire fish swimming 
          up the urethra of humans who dare to urinate while in Amazon waters. 
          Once inside, so we are told, the fish anchors itself with spines, sucks 
          blood, and even gnaws tissue, resulting in excruciating pain. All of 
          this can lead to bladder laceration and hemorrhage, penis amputation, 
          even death. This exquisitely horrifying scenario, the product of two 
          centuries of tall tale embellishment, blends our fear of the jungle 
          and loathing of parasites to yield a nightmare arguably worse than piranha 
          attack, snake bite, or malaria. But how many documented cases of candiru 
          have been reported in all this time? Zero! </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">On 
          the other hand much of the wonder and mystery of the rain forest is 
          well documented. There's the longest and widest river in the world (the 
          Amazon), with pink sunsets and dolphins to match. There are big cats 
          in Amazonia, great apes in Borneo, and giant flesh-eating flowers in 
          Sumatra. A butterfly in New Guinea has a twelve inch wingspan, bigger 
          than many birds. There are flying squirrels and howling monkeys. Spiders 
          eat birds, ants cut leaves, and fish squirt water. Fig trees strangle 
          other trees. There are tiny frogs with poison and giant snakes without. 
          A species of fish eats people and one of sharks eats plants. Yikes.

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          rain forest is truly a magical place, a fairy tale that is real. To 
          walk into its palpable presence is to come alive with all the senses. 
          This is the Garden of Eden, the world as it was bequeathed, the most 
          complex and beautiful corner of the known universe. Whether it's a spider's 
          web bejeweled with morning dew, the flick of a lizard's tongue, a snake 
          swallowing a snake, or a monkey crashing through the canopy, there is 
          always something to enchant.</font></p>
