          inhumanity to man is well documented, but what about to other life forms? 
          Do we just beat up on each other or are we really not that selective? 
          Consider the following.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
          The largest known animal species to ever live is the blue whale, twice 
          the size of <em>Argentinosaurus</em>, the biggest of the dinosaurs. 
          In the early 1900's whalers, operating out of Grytviken station on the 
          subantarctic island of South Georgia, butchered 25,000 baleen whales 
          in 50 years. Many of them were blues, which are highly endangered as 
          a result. In the process they killed a speciman that was 110 feet long 
          and weighed nearly 400,000 pounds! <em>The largest animal that has ever 
          live</em>d! The measuring techniques were crude at the time, yet remarkably 
          accurate. </font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Abraham 
          walked the earth when certain bristlecone pines first thrust their roots 
          into the high rocky soil of California's White Mountains. These ancient 
          pines are living ruins today, fittingly stunted and gnarled to look 
          the part. Windblown ice and sand have scoured the wood smooth and beautiful, 
          as if worked by the hand of god. The oldest known tree is Methuselah 
          at 4800 years, making it the oldest living thing on earth. But Methuselah 
          is new at being the oldest. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Once 
          upon a time there was Prometheus, a bristlecone pine tree that lived 
          in the same White Mountains. And there was a geologist in search of 
          information about Ice Age glaciers, and was willing to do anything to 
          get it. One day he was taking core samples from the bristlecone pines 
          when he came upon a tree he knew to be very, very old. As he sampled 
          the ancient tree his coring tool broke off. Rather than wait for another 
          tool to arrive in a few weeks the man asked for, and received<em>, </em>permission 
          from the U.S. Forest Service to fell the tree. That is to murder it 
          with a chain saw. Prometheus proved to be 4,950 years old, <em>the oldest 
          known organism to ever live on earth</em>-300 years old as the pyramids 
          were being built in Egypt!</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Neither 
          the scientist, nor the Forest Service, the designated guardian of our 
          forests, ever expressed remorse at this act. The public, however, expressed 
          outrage, and so today the identity of the Methuselah tree is kept secret 
          to prevent a similar fate.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia"> The answer to our question 
          is thus clear. Our callous disregard for life knows no bounds. </font></p>
