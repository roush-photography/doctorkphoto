        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          next major event that literally &quot;fueled&quot; the rise of human 
          domination on our planet began in England. In 1713 ironmaster Abraham 
          Darby began to use coal instead of charcoal to smelt (melt ore to separate 
          metal) iron. It would be the first step in unlocking the staggering 
          potential of fossil fuels. In the ensuing years coal began to power 
          steam engines which were put to work in factories, mines, and railroads. 
          The Industrial Revolution was born.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          Then, in 1859, the world's first commercial oil well spewed crude out 
          of the Pennsylvania earth, another event that would prove a game changer, 
          like agriculture. Oil has been mentioned in human history since the 
          time of Rome, but only as seeps. Now it was gushing! The oil well would 
          make vast quantities of gasoline available to power engines, especially 
          new modes of getting from here to there. First was Mr. Ford's Model 
          T. Shortly thereafter the brothers Wright flew their plane at Kitty 
          Hawk and aviation was off and flying. A revolution in transportation 
          was underway.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          there is more to this than just rendering the horse, buggy, and passenger 
          ship obsolete. Spinoff industries from oil included paint, plastics, 
          and chemicals. Chemicals became fertilizers and pesticides which increased 
          food production by a factor of two. The result was the modern &quot;agro-industrial 
          world,&quot; with more people living in larger cities and fed by rural 
          megafarms. And it was all connected by asphalt arteries and hi-tech 
          communication.</font></p>

          has not penetrated every corner of the world. This is a rural village
