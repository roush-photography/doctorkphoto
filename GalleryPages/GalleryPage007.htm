      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">When 
        you get right down to it, human population growth and the disproportionate 
        resource consumption of an expanding world middle class are the forces 
        behind man's degradation of the planet. The conversion of more and more 
        natural habitat to agriculture and urban sprawl drives the loss of biodiversity 
        everywhere, even in terrain once considered marginal. The unsustainable 
        harvest of nature's bounty by affluent nations threatens to sterilize 
        land and sea. We have already been responsible for the early exit of many 
        species, most we aren't even aware of. Millions more will follow as we 
        continue to do what we've always done. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Modern 
        man appeared on the scene some 100,000 years ago and has since come to 
        dominate planet earth. In this brief span of time our species has multiplied 
        and spread to every corner of the globe, even maintaining a presence in 
        Antarctica and space. He did this initially by adapting to his environment 
        like every other species must do. But then, about 10,000 years ago, man 
        and his tool making genius began to change the world to suit his needs. 
        Yikes! An agricultural revolution was born and things have never been 
        the same. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
        have also begun to understand this tiny blue orb, its genesis, and even 
        the greater universe beyond. We understand the origin of species and their 
        importance to the planet's life support systems. We know the balance of 
        nature is delicate and have witnessed the dire consequences of our endless 
        meddling with it.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
        know. We know! What on earth will we do?</font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        struggle for life unfolds right in front of us, as in the scene above, 
        if we just look for it. This picture was taken near our lodge, Refugio 
        Ecologico Caiman, in the Pantanal.</font></p>
