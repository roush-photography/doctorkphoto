          For amber waves of grain<br>

          Above the fruited plain<br>

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          assumed that when I crossed the border from Kansas to Colorado that 
          the Front Range would just be there, in all its majesty, as in the anthem. 
          Wrong. Eastern Colorado was a mirror image of western Kansas, flat and 
          dusty. Desperate townships pock marked the highway and were verily unattractive, 
          like pimples. Dogs ran in packs, urinating on scrubby trees and rusty 
          gas pumps. Old men played checkers on town squares, and chewed and spit. 
          Beer cans and broken bottles sparkled among the stubble on the roadside. 
          Every road sign had been shot dead several times. And still I search 
          for the Coor's commercial? </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Two 
          hours later, at some nameless crossroads, I veered left on Highway 24 
          and found it. The sun was bright, the sky cobalt blue, and an armada 
          of clouds skimmed the horizon to announce the awesome presence of the 
          Rocky Mountains in the distance. The more I drove the bigger they loomed. 
          I was filled with happiness. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          road eventually led up and over Wilkerson Pass. On the down side a wide 
          valley appeared with flowered fields, glistening streams, and log cabins 
          pressed against muscular mountains. It was heaven and, best of all, 
          I had it almost to myself. As I approached the town of Buena Vista the 
          earth fell away to a low plain which revealed the Collegiate Peaks ahead, 
          the most formidable range in the lower 48 with 16 fourteeners, purple 
          and snowcapped, spread over a 30 mile front. I descended into town with 
          a <em>Rocky Mountain High.</em></font></p>
