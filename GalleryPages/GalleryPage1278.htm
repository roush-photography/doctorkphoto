        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          awaken on my first morning in Delhi, bright-eyed and eager to see it 
          all. I dress hastily and quickstep out the Imperial Hotel and onto the 
          streets for a pre-dawn stroll to watch the city awaken. The nearest 
          thing to peace in downtown Delhi takes place at this perfect hour, in 
          the dim light of primal dawn, when the air still has a fresh, unused 
          feel to it. At this time even the most ardent debauchers are still at 
          roost. And not just in the slums. I ponder the eerie quiet as I step 
          over a few of the city&#8217;s many homeless who have made their nest 
          this night in the fashionable hotel district. Bodies lie like flotsam, 
          in doorways, under poster-plastered trees, and in gutters. <br>
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          walk about a mile, past a single familiar logo-McDonalds, touting its 
          muttonburger Maharaja Mac (no sacred beefburgers in Hinduland)-then 
          turn back toward the hotel. Already in this brief timespan the cityscape 
          has morphed. A hazy light now overlays the streets, casting an eerie 
          mood over the dawn. Smoke and dust fill the air and explain my sudden 
          cough. There are many more people milling about, a fraction of Delhi&#8217;s 
          22 million, give or take. Who&#8217;s counting any more? On the distant 
          hillsides, now visible in the gloaming, are sprawling shantytowns, the 
          willy-nilly brown blight that creeps over the environs hourly as migrants 
          arrive from rural villages, seeking a better life. Same old, same old.

        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I took 
          more people pictures in India than anywhere I&#8217;d ever been. There 
          are simply no stereotypes here. Everyone looks made up to a Westerner, 
          like Holloween. Which means, of course, they need to have their picture 
          taken. This mosque was my first visit to the world of Islam and I wanted 
          to make sure that I followed all the rules. As it turned out Muslims 
          were like everyone else. They didn&#8217;t seem to care what I was up 
          to as they got on with their daily lives. <br>
