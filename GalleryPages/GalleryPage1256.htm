        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">An 
          astonishing diversity has evolved since life began in the swishing tide 
          pools of a fledgling earth. Tropical and temperate zones are teeming 
          with species, many still awaiting discovery. Even near the poles, the 
          oceans boil with fantastic forms, frolicking, feeding, and being fed 
          upon. And yet, as enduring as things seem to us, few of today's species 
          would be recognized by those that lived even a short time ago, say a 
          million years. In fact, 99.9% of all species that ever lived have died. 
          Gone extinct. As sure as the individual lives and dies, so too does 
          his kind. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Yet 
          the death of an individual or a species is not a bad thing. It is part 
          of the natural order and necessary to create a niche for new species, 
          better adapted to a changing planet. In fact, that's how we got here. 
          For eons the great reptiles were earth's apex predators. Slinking in 
          the shadows, however, was a group of small, hairy, and unassuming creatures, 
          trying to stay out from underfoot. Then along came an asteroid and everything 
          changed. Giants tumbled and the mouse roared. Without the bully reptiles, 
          mammals were free to strut their stuff, primarily an expanding forebrain, 
          and later an upright posture and opposable thumbs. And strut they did, 
          until finally we came along, thinking and grasping our way to the top. 
          The new apex predator. So what was bad for the reptile was good for 
          the mammal, ultimately unleashing human intellect, arguably the greatest 
          force there ever was!</font></p>

          Okavango Delta, a seasonal wetland of northern Botswana, is an area 
          of great biodiversity. This beautiful saddle-billed stork is one of 
          its most striking residents. The stork is doing well in Botswana but 
          is listed as endangered in neighboring South Africa. (next photo)</font></p>
