      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
        1944, the U.S. Coast Guard introduced 29 caribou to St. Matthew Island 
        in the remote Bering Sea, off the coast of Alaska. The idea was to provide 
        the sailors with some recreational hunting to counteract the doldrums 
        of this godforsaken deployment. A short time later the Coast Guard did 
        the sailors one better and closed the station, removing the caribou's 
        only predator from the island. An ad hoc ecological experiment ensued. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        flora of this windswept outpost consists of lichens, grasses, and dwarf 
        willow, classic tundra and a caribou banquet. With abundant vegetation, 
        no predators, and no escape, conditions were ripe for a boom-bust cycle. 
        And that's just what happened. In less than two decades the caribou population 
        exploded, <em>from 29 to 6,000</em>, an unsustainable number on the tiny 
        island. Tundra became trampled and overgrazed, the once plentiful food 
        source a thing of the past. Tundra depends on the constant movement of 
        caribou to reduce their impact in any one place, and suddenly there was 
        no room to move on St. Matthew. The robust condition of the herd deteriorated 
        in step with the tundra.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
        year later, in 1964, after a particularly brutal winter, the population 
        of caribou plummeted to just 42 individuals. In 1966, the caribou of St. 
        Matthew were gone, population zero, a boom-bust cycle of just 22 years.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Lesson: 
        Like Easter Island, St. Matthew Island was a limited space with finite 
        resources from which there was no escape. The results were the same. Without 
        a healthy environment there was collapse of the dominant species.<br>
