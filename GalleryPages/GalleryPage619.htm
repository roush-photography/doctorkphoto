          fueling population growth the agricultural revolution was the most important 
          event leading to the dominion of our species over the earth. This growth 
          accelerated, slowly at first, then explosively (doubling in less than 
          35 years) in the past 200 years. The impact on planet earth has been 
          nothing short of biblical.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As 
          natural habitat is converted to agriculture, complex ecosystems are 
          replaced by species-poor farms and ranches. An estimated 25% or more 
          of temperate forests and grasslands have been lost to agriculture worldwide. 
          And more than half of all tropical rain forests, containing nearly 50% 
          of earth's terrestrial biodiversity, have been cleared for agriculture 
          and other human activities. The number of cattle in the Amazon region 
          increased from 25 to 55 million in the last 10 years. And palm oil plantations 
          have the very real potential to wipe out all of the rain forests of 
          Indonesia and Southeast Asia in the next 20 years. To fly over what 
          was recently &quot;Wild Borneo&quot; and witness the vast palm oil monoculture, 
          extending to the horizon in all directions, is to truly grasp man's 
          transformative powers. Palm oil is found in many of the products in 
          a modern supermarket, including margarine, soap, pizza, and ice cream, 
          to name a few. Its &quot;usefullness&quot; is predicted to increase 
          over time. </font></p>

          feeds more people on planet earth than any other food. In many parts
