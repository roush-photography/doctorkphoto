          Ed Ricketts</font></em></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There 
          was a dramatic illustration of our complacency toward the oceans during 
          the International Geophysical Year of 1957. Oceanographers in the U.S. 
          proudly announced to the world that they were going to dump radioactive 
          wastes into the ocean and check out the effects. And they were serious! 
          Tons of the radioactive goo were stored in 55 gallon drums, similar 
          to ones you might see <em>rusting</em> in any industrial yard. They 
          were hauled on barges to an area near the Faralon Islands (which happen 
          to be near San Francisco), off the California coast, and dumped into 
          the drink. Many of them didn't sink so U.S. Navy gunners shot them full 
          of holes to let water in. And, of course, uranium and plutonium out. 
          By the time the project was stopped in the early nineties hundreds of 
          thousands of drums lay rusting on the ocean floor around the United 
          States. And we weren''t alone in this fiasco. Many other developed nations 
          enthusiastically joined in. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And too, 
          we've been to the moon and outer reaches of the solar system, yet still 
          know relatively little about our oceans. For example the largest creature 
          that ever lived was not a dinosaur at all. It IS the blue whale and, 
          though endangered, she still swims the seas. The largest of these leviathans 
          ever recorded was harpooned by whalers off South Georgia Island, in 
          the Southern Ocean, in 1926. She measured 111 feet long and a whopping 
          400,000 pounds, twice as big as any dinasaur.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">To bring 
          these numbers into better focus, a blue whale calf can weigh three tons 
          (adult rhino size) at birth and grow 200 pounds a day on mom's milk. 
          And as British filmmaker David Attenborough famously said, an adult 
          blue whale's &quot;tongue weighs as much as an elephant, its heart is 
          the size of a Volkswagon, and you could swim in its largest blood vessels.&quot; 
          And yet despite this &quot;wonder&quot; that still lives among us we 
          know very little about it other than measurements. </font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I love 
          visiting out of the way places where few have been, and the whaling 
          station at Grytviken, established at South Georgia in 1904, is certainly 
          one of those. The great explorer Ernest Shackleton began his fateful 
          Trans-Antarctic Expedition here in 1914 and is buried under the white 
          cross. This is where the massive blue whale mentioned in the text was 
          taken. About 25, 000 whales were harvested in waters off South Georgia 
          before the station closed in 1966. The whalers were then unemployed. 
          Someone forgot to tell them that if you kill all the whales there won't 
          be any left to make new whales. The mathematical formula for this is 
          X-X=0, where X is the number of whales in the ocean AND the number you 
          take out of the ocean. Admittedly these can be hard concepts to grasp.
