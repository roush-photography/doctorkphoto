        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Round 
          Island is ridiculously remote, even by Alaska standards. It is 20 miles 
          off the southwest coast, in Bristol Bay, and a hundred miles or so from 
          the nearest road and airport, located in the fishing village of Dillingham. 
          It is a place seldom seen by anyone but lost fishermen and wildlfe photographers. 
          Naturally I had to check it out.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
          two mile chunk of rock is a wildlife refuge for walrus. About 15,000 
          of these heavyweights &quot;haul out&quot; here and relax during the 
          brief boreal summer. The reason walrus gather on Round Island is because 
          people don't. No more than six visitors are allowed at one time. I seldom 
          saw another soul during my five days there. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          walrus' glistening white tusks are huge, elongated canine teeth, coveted 
          by the world's ivory trade. They are multipurpose with some of the actions 
          suggesting tool use. They are principally used in fighting, but also 
          as an &quot;ice axe&quot; to hoist the beast's considerable bulk onto 
          ice floes, and as &quot;ski poles&quot; to propel them along the ocean 
          bottom as they search for clams. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As 
          with the elephant, this remarkable tusk has been the species downfall, 
          the basis for poaching to near extinction in some cases. Today walrus 
          are found in only a few scattered herds in the arctic and subarctic 
          realms. Gone are thriving populations in the North Atlantic, around 
          Labrador, and at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River. This latter herd 
          was once more than 250,000 strong. Now it is zero weak. Someone forgot 
          to tell these hunters that if you kill all the walrus there will not 
          be any left. And no walrus equals no tusks, which, if you're selling 
          tusks for income, generally means no paycheck. Admittedly these can 
          be hard concepts to grasp. </font></p>
