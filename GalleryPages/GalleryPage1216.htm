          and show people a world barely imaginable to them.<br>
          David Doubilet (Photographer)</em></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          Along with overpopulation, climate change, and the threat of thermonuclear 
          war, the persistent decline of the world's oceans ranks among the great 
          global crises confronting the human race today. But this huge threat 
          to planet earth receives only a fraction of the &quot;press&quot; as 
          the loss of tropical rain forests or charismatic megafauna. These are 
          part of our vivid sensory experience, while life in the ocean can seem 
          almost imaginary, hid beneath a &quot;dark gauze&quot; at the surface, 
          as Doubilet so eloquently states. Out of sight, out of mind. And yet 
          our future depends on whether or not we take notice of this problem 
          and begin to do something about it. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
          few facts about our oceans: 1) they contain 80% of all life on the planet 
          2) they provide half the oxygen in the atmosphere 3) oceans sequester 
          five times more carbon than tropical rain forests 4) they create and 
          stabilize our climate to a large extent 5) ten percent of people make 
          their livings from the oceans 6) about $25 billion of illegal stock 
          is removed from the oceans every year 7) coral reefs and estuaries, 
          equivalent in productivity and diversity to tropical rain forests, are 
          under serious threat.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It 
          makes no difference whether you live in coastal Oregon or landlocked 
          Kansas, the impact of oceans on the earth's ecological systems knows 
          no boundaries. For our sake and that of unborn generations, indeed for 
          the sake of all life, we must restore the health of the planet's oceans. 
          Nothing we can do, short of avoiding nuclear war, will have a greater 
          impact on the survival of life on earth. And no task before us will 
          require more courage, sacrifice, and true leadership. </font></p>
