        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Easter 
          Island was a cultural &quot;hotspot&quot; when the rest of the world 
          was wallowing in the Dark Ages (the 1600s). Its people were well fed, 
          society tightly organized, and religion highly sophisticated. Society 
          centered on a dozen or so clans, each ruled by a chief. Since food, 
          mostly sweet potatos and chickens, was easily attained, there was ample 
          time for matters of the spirit. A complex form of ancestor worship evolved. 
          Ancestors were believed to provide health and prosperity for the islanders 
          in exchange for offerings and ceremony. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Each clan, 
          at the behest of its chief, constructed ceremonial platforms called 
          <em>ahu</em> upon which they erected giant statues (above). These statues 
          represented incarnations of ancestral chiefs and were extremely important 
          in clan worship. But it was the carving, and especially the transport 
          of the massive <em>moai</em> (largest above weighs 86 tons), which played 
          such a pivotal role in the story of Easter Island. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The islanders 
          had only human power to drag the statues along, using tree trunks as 
          rollers. As the population increased, clans competed to carve the most, 
          and the biggest, statues. Ultimately, there were hundreds of ceremonial 
          platforms and over 800 statues on their tiny singularity.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Then, 
          when the society was at its peak, something mysterious happened. Hundreds 
          of statues were abandoned, along transport roads and at various stages 
          of completion at the quarry. A civilization came to a halt. How? Why? 
          Theories abound-perhaps civil war or genocide? But the major force behind 
          the falling star of Polynesia was environmental degradation brought 
          on by massive deforestation of the entire island. Not a single tree 
          was left standing! Gone with the trees were boats (and thus the means 
          to fish or escape), fuel, and constuction material. And without tree 
          roots there was soil erosion, and thus fewer sweet potatos.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But just 
          as important, without trees for transport there was no reason to carve 
          statues. Thus they had no work, as there was little else to do on the 
          island. The statues were also the backbone of their religious rituals 
          and ceremonial customs. So too their spirit world collapsed. Therefore 
          in the end there was no food, no fuel, no work, no religion, and no 
          escape. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The story 
          of Easter Island presents in stark relief, what happens when we lay 
          waste the world around us. Their social order fell with the last tree, 
          and the islanders became mired in the drawn out paroxysms of societal 
          and environmental collapse.</font></p>
