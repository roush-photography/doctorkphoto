        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Two 
          steps forward, one step back. Maybe two or three. So it goes with the 
          environmental movement. For every solution there are always more problems.

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          1973 an Arab oil embargo caused widespread shortages with increased 
          prices and VERY long lines at the pumps. Stations closed, for a day, 
          or for good. Americans panicked! Speed limits were lowered to 55 MPH 
          on the interstate and thermostats were adjusted to conserve fuel, with 
          President Carter showing the way at the White House. For the first time 
          oil was used to hold our gas-guzzling nation &quot;hostage.&quot; It 
          would not be the last. Talk about alternative energy sources and energy 
          self-sufficiency began to make news. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          1974 scientists discovered that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) from spray 
          cans and refrigerators could destroy atmospheric ozone, essential to 
          filter out harmful radiation from the sun. The result was a significant 
          increase in the incidence of skin cancer. Four years later the United 
          States banned the use of CFCs. This was the beginning of an awareness 
          that many environmental problems were global rather than local. The 
          concept of <em>globalization</em> was born-the knowledge that actions 
          on one side of the globe can effect those living on the other. Planet 
          earth wasn't so big after all. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          1953 a new school was built in Niagara Falls, NY, in an area called 
          Love Canal. A year later construction began on a neighborhood of houses 
          around the school. This in spite of prior warnings by Hooker Chemical 
          company that they had buried 21,000 tons of toxic chemical waste at 
          the site in the 1940s. No surprise when puddles of noxious ooze began 
          to seep through the neighborhood and health and reproductive issues 
          spread at alarming rates in the new residents. The Love Canal disaster 
          made world headlines in the seventies as an example of callous disregard 
          for human life. But it didn't end there. Other highly publicized cases 
          would follow, including Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, Karen Silkwood 
          verses Kerr-McGee in Oklahoma, and Hinkley verses Pacific Gas and Electric 
          in California. The latter two cases were dramatized by Hollywood in 
          award winning feature length films, with Meryl Streep nominated for 
          an oscar in the title role of <em>Silkwood</em> and Julia Roberts winning 
          the oscar for her portrayal of <em>Erin Brockovich.</em></font></p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
          stark contrast to hunter-gatherer societies, the modern world confers 
          a significant standard of living, health, and survival advantage, but 
          at great cost to our planet. The mission of environmental science is 
          to find ways to mitigate man's negative impact as he continues his remarkable 
          dominion over the earth. </font></p>
