        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thomas 
          Malthus was an English economist who, in 1798, formulated a general 
          law of human population based on models that worked well in nature. 
          The law states that local human populations grow until they exceed available 
          food supplies. Then war, famine, and disease decrease the number of 
          people to restore balance. The law also implies that, as with other 
          species, there comes a time of relative stability in numbers. This has 
          yet to happen with humans.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">What 
          Malthus was unable to reason at the time was the ingenuity of his species. 
          As the ink was drying on his dire predictions, the population in already 
          crowded Western Europe began to <em>increase </em>rather than decrease. 
          This happened because of the sudden availability of imported foods from 
          the New World. Agriculture had gone global. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As 
          population continued to increase in Europe cities became cesspools of 
          cholera and typhus. According to Malthus, this would rapidly reverse 
          population growth. But again ingenuity nullified logic. During the mid 
          nineteenth century sewers began to isolate man from his biological wastes, 
          thus averting widespread epidemics. Filtration and chlorination would 
          come along later and add even more protection from water-borne diseases. 
          The net effect was a decrease in childhood mortality which led to an 
          even higher birth rate. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          modern era has seen wonder drugs, vaccines, and improved maternal-child 
          care added to the growing list of developments that have fueled the 
          relentless growth of human numbers. But even more significant was the 
          <em>green revolution</em> of the mid 1900s, a combination of high yield 
          grains, irrigation, and fertilizers, which led to a two to three fold 
          increase in food production. In the process about half of world hunger 
          was eliminated, resulting in an explosion of third world populations 
          that continues to the present. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And 
          now, some gerontologists are forecasting life expectancies of greater 
          than a century in many first world countries. By 2050! Only a pessimist 
          would see all this as gloomy. And yet....</font></p>

          favelas (slums) of Rio in Brazil are a good example of how the poor 
          in second and third world countries live. </font></p>
