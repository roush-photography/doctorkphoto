          Dr. Sun Wolf</font></em></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Despite 
          the fallout of Reagan and Watt from the 1980s, things weren't all terrible 
          as the Century of Conservation drew to a close. It was a fabulous final 
          act with Bill Clinton drawing the curtains. One of history's great voices 
          for the environment was Clinton's choice for Vice President, Al Gore, 
          whose book <em>Earth In the Balance</em> made the New York Times best 
          seller list in the early 90s (the first book by a sitting U.S. senator 
          to do so since John F. Kennedy's Profiles In Courage) and received worldwide 
          acclaim for its exposure of critical environmental issues. After losing 
          the closest presidential election in history to a Supreme Court vote 
          in 2000, the wonkish Gore retired from politics. He moved back home 
          to Tennessee with modest financial means, only to become one of the 
          wealthiest men in the country as a businessman in the private sector. 
          He could have kicked back and counted his change, but he didn't. He 
          returned to his passion, saving the environment, and the human race, 
          by writing his second book, <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em>, aimed at 
          increasing pubic awareness of the threat of global warming, possibly 
          the best statement on the crisis ever made. The book was made into a 
          feature length film. Many accolades would follow, including a rare Triple 
          Crown for Gore and his efforts: the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007; an academy 
          award in 2007; and a Grammy award in 2009.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          biggest environmental battle of the decade, the case of the northern 
          spotted owl, highlighted just how far we had come in the country since 
          six billion passenger pigeons were shot to extinction a century earlier. 
          The owl was listed as threatened by U.S. Fish and Wildlife. Not much 
          problem there. But when the decline was blamed on loss of old growth 
          forests in the Pacific Northwest things got a little testy. The Endangered 
          Species Act of 1973 demanded that measures be taken to save the species, 
          which meant setting aside large tracts of these ancient forests as preserves. 
          Logging would have to be banned which, of course, put loggers out of 
          work. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          media had a field day with this one, pitting loggers and owls eyeball 
          to eyeball, in the news and on magazine covers, sensationalism at its 
          best. In the end the forests were preserved, owls got a new lease on 
          life, a new anticancer drug (taxol) was discovered in the bark of the 
          trees that were saved, and the loggers adjusted. The venomous rhetoric 
          died down much sooner than expected and life returned mostly to normal 
          in the Pacific Northwest. There were fewer logging trucks on the road 
          but more RVs, bringing happy tourists to see the forests that were saving 
          owls and helping win the war on breast and ovarian cancer. And if you 
          listened real carefully as you walked in these woods you could hear 
          the tourists exclaim, &quot;By god these trees are big!&quot; And the 
          trees were by God.</font></p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          giant redwoods of northern California are the only trees larger than 
          the magnificent Douglas firs of the Pacific Northwest, tracts of which 
          were protected to help save the spotted owl. Only about three percent 
          of old growth redwoods remain and about 20% of Douglas firs, mostly 
          in national forests.</font></p>
