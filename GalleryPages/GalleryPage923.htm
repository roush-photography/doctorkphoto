        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the 
          village of Liatung I take my seat on a viewing platform to witness the 
          funeral I have come so far to see. This is the ultimate event in the 
          religious and social life of Tana Toraja. The pageantry and solemnity 
          of the <em>feast of the setting sun </em>will commemorate the life of 
          Du'nang, a nobleman who died 6 months ago. Swaddled in homespun quilts, 
          he waits patiently in his <em>tongkonan</em>, or traditional Toraja 
          home, for burial at the most auspicious time. During this interlude, 
          which can last for years, his two favorite wives have been in constant 
          attendance. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The supreme 
          symbol of status and wealth in Tana Toraja is the buffalo, which trumps 
          the ubiquitous scooter, the occasional car, and even a man's home. Because 
          Du'nang was a nobleman at least 12, and as many as 75, buffalo must 
          be sacrificed at his funeral, which can last for weeks and will be attended 
          by all the surrounding villages. Buffalo will be provided by the vIllagers 
          who are indebted to Du'nang in one way or another. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">From my 
          vantage point I see guests streaming to the funeral. The footpaths and 
          dirt roads are clogged with whole villages arriving in unison, walking 
          or riding scooters, solemnly bearing their gifts. They are colorfully 
          attired according to their role at the feast, dancer, singer, server, 
          butcher etc. Buffalo lead the processions, some for sacrifice, some 
          for fighting, and some just for show. Hundreds of squealing pigs are 
          suspended from bamboo poles, protesting the indignity, and perhaps their 
          fate. Chickens cluck in wicker baskets. Many villagers carry tote sacks 
          of rice or bamboo tubes of <em>tuak</em>, the fermented juice of the 
          sugar palm. Finally, a runner makes his rounds through the village to 
          announce &quot;It begins.&quot;(next photo)</font></p>
