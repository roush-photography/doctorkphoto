      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Another 
        hot, sultry day in Delhi. The thermometer reads 105 degrees. Smoke and 
        dust fill the air and choke the lungs. Streets and sidewalks buckle with 
        people. Twenty two million of them, give or take a few. More arrive daily 
        from towns and villages, squeezing into sprawling shantytowns, the willy-nilly 
        brown blight that seems to creep hourly into what's left of the surrounding 
        countryside.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
        donkey plods along on the divided highway that channels people into the 
        maze of Old Delhi, <em>in the wrong direction</em>! A family of five clings 
        to a motor scooter, toddlers dangling, colorful clothes flapping in the 
        breeze. Buses start and stop, crammed with people and their blank stares. 
        Scruffy kids dart in and out of traffic, hands extended for a handout. 
        Sacred cows graze in garbage heaps, alongside goats, pigs, and feral dogs. 
        They slowly chew their cud of stale produce and paper. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
        mostly in Delhi there are people, smelly, inescapable, scurrying to and 
        fro, like molecular motion. A suffocating mass of humanity. People walking, 
        talking, squatting, smoking, and sleeping. People riding and herding animals. 
        People urinating, defecating, and spitting, coating the city with a patina 
        of filth and disease. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Also 
        in Delhi are hospitals, bloated with the sick. No wonder! </font></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Mother 
        and daughter share a private moment of ritual ablutions in crowded India. 
        A nation of a billion people, most of them poor, India is expected to 
        increase to 1.6 billion by mid-century. Then, for the first time in history, 
        India, not China, will have the dubious distinction of being the world's 
        most populous nation.</font></p>
