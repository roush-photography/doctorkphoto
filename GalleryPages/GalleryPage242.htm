        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          attraction between dolphins and people goes back thousands of years. 
          Ancient Greek artists decorated coins, pottery, and walls with their 
          pictures, and the animals appear in Greek and Roman mythology. The Greeks 
          considered the dolphin sacred to their god Apollo. For centuries sailors 
          have considered their presence near the bow of a ship as a good omen. 
          They seem to bond with people and seafaring lore is replete with tales 
          of human rescue by these intelligent creatures. </font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          slithered into the lukewarm waters off Roatan, an island east of Honduras, 
          to frolic with trainer Brandy and her flippered friends. It wasn't long 
          before we attracted a crowd, dolphins zipping all around in their glistening 
          majesty. I soon found myself eyeball to eyeball with a bottle nose and 
          an impish grin, both of us suspended in hydrospace. They had come to 
          play, like puppies, only wetter. They accepted us, pimples and all, 
          with obvious frivolity. I don't know who smiled the most.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">On 
          my last evening in Roatan, I sat alone on the beach and watched sunset 
          encircle the island with an iridescent glow, then melt away in a blaze 
          of magenta glory. I had journeyed south to join a pod of dolphins in 
          their world, to watch them play in the moonlight and dance in the sun. 
          I was content to be in their benign presence, a kindred spirit at sea, 
          ever smiling at Poseidon, ever cavorting at the bow of our ships. </font></p>
