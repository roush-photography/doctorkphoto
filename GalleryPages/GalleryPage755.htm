        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The United 
          States at the turn of the 20th century was a land of farms and small 
          towns. New York was our only large city and the word <em>magacity</em> 
          hadn't even made the dictionary yet. Immigrants arrived on Ellis Island 
          in droves, mostly from Europe in those days. A fledgling automobile 
          industry was seen as no match for the horse and buggy in turn of the 
          century rural America. Bison had all but disappeared from the western 
          plains, reduced to a meager thousand, barely holding on in Yellowstone 
          Park. In the nation's few urban centers the fashion of the day for women 
          was the hat, the bigger the better, adorned with showy feathers and 
          stuffed bird carcasses. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">America 
          was, however, poised for change. The concept of conservation was being 
          whispered by a few visionaries who condemned what Thoreau called &quot;our 
          war with wilderness.&quot; And it was none too soon as developers stood 
          at the rim of the Grand Canyon and roared, white-tailed deer were hunted 
          to near extinction in some states, and more herons, egrets, and ibis 
          adorned hats in cities than waded the Everglades. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          dawn of the new century saw help arrive in the form of advocates for 
          wildlife. A sign of the new times took place on March 25, 1900, when 
          Congress passed the Lacey Act, meant to stop the slaughter of wading 
          birds by commercial hunters. It was a landmark piece of legislation 
          that hinted at a new ethic. Less than a year later a man called &quot;Teddy&quot; 
          became president, the first person ever to &quot;carry a big stick&quot; 
          for conservation. His list of achievements protecting wilderness and 
          wildlife have become legendary. His booming personality single-handedly 
          launched what has become known as the <em>Century of Conservation.</em></font></p>
