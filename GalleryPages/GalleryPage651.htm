        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          wild American West has moved south, specifically to Brazil, where it 
          is alive and well in all its gold, glory, and decadence. The geography 
          has changed but the methods, motives, and mistakes are pretty much the 
          same. The Oregon Trail is now the Trans-Amazonia Highway, the Conestoga 
          wagon a rickety old bus, and the prairie homestead is a jungle bungalow. 
          And California gold has resurfaced in Rondonia. A closer look at the 
          brief and bumbled history of Rondonia will make clear the plight of 
          Brazil's imperiled western wilderness. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          rush began in the early eighties and population growth in the region 
          soared to 15%, five times the explosive world rate. The &quot;dirt poor&quot; 
          of the east headed west, from the barrios of Rio and Sao Paulo to the 
          steamy hope of Rondonia. They chased riches, or at least dreams of a 
          better life, hacked out of the dank jungles of Amazonia. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It 
          began as it usually does, with a road, BR-364, a 900 mile red dirt spine 
          that was eventually paved to entice even more people to switch slums. 
          Such migratory swells haven't been seen since the days of California's 
          49ers. The capital of Porta Velho, only recently a nearly inaccessible, 
          barely populated outpost, has swollen with the highway's arterial pulse 
          to over half a million refugee have-nots. (next photo)</font></p>
