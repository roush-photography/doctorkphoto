          G. Bynum-first grade student</font></em></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Across 
          the U.S. and around the world pollinators are in deep trouble, some 
          at risk of extinction. There is much talk and hand-wringing, and almost 
          no action over this crisis. This is not a &quot;sweep under the rug&quot; 
          issue we can ignore until it goes away. How serious it it? Forests, 
          prairies, wetlands, croplands, and every other terrestrial habitat on 
          the planet depend on a healthy pollinator community to keep us and our 
          animal friends well fed and healthy. Globally about 85% of all flowering 
          plants require assistance from the birds and bees etc to produce seeds 
          and fruit. Without them the earth's biodiversity will plummet. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The players 
          in this high stakes game are well known. They include bats, hummingbirds, 
          songbirds, and other vertebrates. But the key players are small, the 
          spineless bees and others that zip around the backyard, and in the face. 
          With a few exceptions (butterflies) we label them pests and spray them 
          with poison. Maybe we should rethink this approach. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Agriculture 
          depends heavily on managed European honeybees. Colonies are trucked 
          from farm to farm like migrant workers to pollinate a hundred or so 
          commercial crops, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, and more. There 
          are about three million of these colonies in the U.S. alone and they 
          contribute more than $24 billion to our nation's economy, not to mention 
          health, each year. There's an old saying that you can thank a honeybee 
          for one out of every three bites you eat!</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The crisis 
          began in 2006. &quot;Migrant&quot; worker bees leaving the colony for 
          a day on the farm stopped returning to hive. The queen was abandoned 
          by her subjects in this &quot;rapture of the bees.&quot; Losses from 
          30-90% were reported by beekeepers in the first few years of what came 
          to be called colony collapse disorder. Farmers and beekeepers flocked 
          to Washington to tell lawmakers of their plight. They predicted a tenfold 
          increase in food prices if the honeybee crisis persisted. In the ten 
          years since this well-publicized problem began to unfold, Washington 
          has done nothing. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">How could 
          this have happened? To start with we are dousing our country with agrochemicals 
          produced by giant companies like Bayer and Monsanto, including neonicotinoids, 
          or &quot;neonics.&quot; Prior to their release the companies undertook 
          multimillion dollar marketing campaigns to assure the EPA, Congress, 
          and the public that their chemicals were safe for humans and did not 
          harm non-targeted species. This hype was swallowed hook, line, and sinker. 
          And the result-colony collapse disorder, farmlands converted to agri-deserts, 
          billions of dollars in profit for corporate America, and no telling 
          how many politicians in company pockets. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There 
          are many confounding variables in the bee story such as mites, viruses, 
          and loss of foraging habitat (from the use of Roundup, another Monsanto 
          poison). But the bottom line is until we turn back the tidal wave of 
          bee killing pesticides unleashed in this country in recent years, there 
          will not be a recovery. Europe is already doing so.</font></p>
