        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Bhutan 
          is a Switzerland-sized Himalayan mountain kingdom wedged between two 
          giants of the region, Tibet and India. Linked historically and culturally 
          to Tibet, yet unnerved by the Chinese invasion of that country in the 
          1950s, Bhutan has snuggled up to India for security in the last half 
          century. Though there has been tension at times, and one serious skirmish, 
          the relationship has benefited the little kingdom for the most part, 
          providing financial aid and skilled labor. So India gets jobs, Bhutan 
          gets construction, and everybody is mostly happy. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Known 
          as Druk Yul, Land of the Thunder Dragon, Bhutan was a loose conglomeration 
          of fiefdoms (feudal estates) until 1907 when a dynasty of kings was 
          established. This is a nation that clings to the past, yet over the 
          course of the last century there has been a cautious shift toward modernity, 
          mostly in health care and education. The kingdom was finally opened 
          to tourism in the nineties, on a limited basis. Only in the last decade 
          has the king allowed the use of televisions, computers, and cell phones. 
          Citizens must wear traditional dress in public and cannot use tobacco 
          anywhere, anytime (tourists are allowed to for now).</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Because 
          of this isolation and reverence for the past, Bhutan has been slow to 
          develop its natural resources. Consequently most forests are virgin 
          and rivers free-flowing. More than half of the land surface has been 
          set aside as forest preserves, lush oak and evergreen spangled with 
          rhododendrons, where endangered species such as tiger, snow leopard, 
          and wild oxen still hang out. There are, in addition, over 500 species 
          of birds. As Bhutan gradually opens its doors to the 21st century, a 
          stated objective of the king is to do so with minimal impact on the 
          environment. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          young king and queen of Bhutan are adored like rock stars. Both were 
          educated at Ivy League schools in the States but chose to return to 
          their own country to live and reign. </font></p>
