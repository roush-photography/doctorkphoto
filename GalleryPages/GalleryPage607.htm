          seal is the &quot;Rodney Dangerfield&quot; of the ocean, garnering little 
          respect in human circles.<font face="Georgia"> Not so the great white 
          shark, fighter jet of the deep, or bottlenose dolphin, the brainchild. 
          And all acknowledge his highness the blue whale, grand leviathan of 
          the high seas. </font></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">But what about this grandest 
          of seals? Why no respect? Well, for starters, it's the comic physique. 
          The words ponderous and homely come to mind. Or moose. Even the elephant 
          seal's trunk is just wrong, like it's been smushed. It's the subject 
          of jokes. Not so his African namesake. His is the right trunk, a wonder 
          of wonders. Why so?</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">It turns out to be a 
          problem of perspective. Topside, where we humans observe them, the elephant 
          seal is like the proverbial duck out of water. Submerged, however, it's 
          a different story. It turns out that this seal is a warm blooded submarine. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">After two months of turf 
          wars on rocky beaches around the world, during which time they mostly 
          fight and make love, the beachmasters and their harems slither into 
          the sea. Once underwater an almost magical transformation takes place. 
          They become nimble and quick, venturing halfway round the world in pursuit 
          of fish and squid. They can dive a mile deep for two hours. That's deeper 
          than a sub! They then surface, recover in minutes, and dive again! These 
          feats are made possible by some really nifty circulatory shenanigans 
          as well as a mammoth blood volume. So extraordinary are these seal-a-thons 
          that scientists are attaching devices to the beasts to gather data on 
          climate change. So forget the comic nose and physique, this superhero 
          is helping to save the planet.</font></p>
