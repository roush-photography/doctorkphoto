        <p align="center"><em>Environmental destruction is a great and accelerating 
          evil.<br>
          George Schaller</em></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">The environmental movement 
          of the sixties in this country was a response to a long history of overexploitation 
          of species, environmental degradation, and sometimes outright calamity. 
          These in turn sparked scientific study, grass roots action, and legislation. 
          Increased awareness of issues resulted from the powerful new medium 
          of television, as well as the visual arts and literature. Nearly 50 
          years of this awareness has spawned a brand new science (environmental 
          science), a new vocabulary, and even revised school curricula. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">In 1962 Rachel Carson 
          warned us that &quot;we were silencing songs we'd never heard.&quot; 
          <em>Silent Spring</em> was published, her bestseller and winner of the 
          National Book Award, that presented the scenario of a world without 
          birdsong and other dire consequences if pollution of the environment 
          and use of DDT continued. President Kennedy read the book and charged 
          his Science Advisory Committee to study the &quot;pesticide problem&quot; 
          and make recommendations. The link between DDT and plummeting bird populations 
          was firmly established and the pesticide was banned in the U.S. and 
          most other developed countries in the early seventies. Carson, the shy 
          and unassuming scientist, would be credited with starting a revolution-the 
          modern environmental movement-still going strong 50 years later. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">This was a grass roots 
          revolution in which a newly militant citizenry demanded the curtailment 
          of pollution, the cleanup of polluted environments, and the protection 
          of pristine areas. Established organizations were joined by new ones 
          such as the Natural Resources Defense Council and Greenpeace, among 
          many others. In response to the pressure Congress created the Environmental 
          Protection Agency and passed numerous laws protecting the environment 
          and wildlife, such as the Clean Air Act of 1970, the Clean Water Act 
          of 1972, and the Endangered Species Act of 1973. A disastrous hazardous 
          waste problem at Love Canal, in New York, led to the Superfund Act of 
          1980. Scientific studies on acid rain, the thinning of atmospheric ozone, 
          and climate change would lead to further grass roots activity and policy 
          changes. </font></p>
