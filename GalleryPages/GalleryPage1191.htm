          the vulnerability of this planet. <br>
          President John F. Kennedy</font></em></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          &quot;Century of Conservation&quot; was launched like a rocket by the 
          fiery personality of Teddy Roosevelt in the first decade of the twentieth 
          century. After this brief period of enlightenment TR's progressivism 
          ground to a near halt. For nearly four decades environmental issues 
          were overshadowed by two world wars and the Great Depression. Conservation 
          legislation barely trickled through a Congress overwhelmed by international 
          crises. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">When 
          World War II was finally over, however, an emerging optimism could not 
          be contained. The United States had won the&quot;greatest of all wars&quot; 
          with new technologies and would now convert these to peacetime applications, 
          including space exploration, computers, and wonder drugs. This fueled 
          a swagger just waiting to happen after years of war and depression. 
          Babies were booming and so was the national economy. The good times 
          were finally rolling.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
          new problems challenged the exuberant nation. The air in our northeastern 
          cities had become thick and hazy, irritating to eyes and lungs. Streetlights 
          in the larger cities stayed on during the day. Snowfall changed from 
          white to various shades of gray. Public lands across the country were 
          threatened by greedy developers, and parks were overrun by hordes of 
          littering tourists. Rivers and beaches were fouled with oil, chemicals, 
          sewage, and medical waste, the scraps of man's daily activities. A river 
          in downtown Cleveland burst into flames from a massive oil slick. Birds 
          dropped dead out of the sky. Bald eagle numbers decreased to 300 nesting 
          pairs, our national bird facing the real possibility of extinction in 
          the lower 48. It was clear we were seriously contaminating our environment.

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Colorado 
          is one of my favorite places on the planet. I visit at least once a 
          year. It has something for nearly everyone who likes the outdoors. The 
          Maroon Bells in the photograph are two of Colorado's 55 &quot;fourteeners,&quot; 
          or mountains that are higher than 14,000 feet. The &quot;Bells&quot; 
          are tough to climb but easy to photograph. (next photo)</font></p>
