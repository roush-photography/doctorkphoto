          obscene phone call from nature.<br>
          The air-moist, sultry, secretive, and far from fresh-felt as it were 
          being exhaled into one's face.<br>

        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          thermometer reads 90 degrees in the shade. As I stroll around the ramshackle 
          village of Bambo, in the jungle of Belize, the humidity clings to me 
          and turns to sweat. This menacing presence is the signature of the tropics, 
          the oppressive yoke that possesses every tortured thought. It's hard 
          to find air in all the wet; I feel as if I'm being vacuum sealed. The 
          stillness is oppressive. Claustrophobia! Suddenly I am short of breath. 
          Slight panic, if there is such a thing. I sit down in a shady spot and 
          try to calm myself. I'm from New Orleans and should be accustomed to 
          this. Then I remembered, that's why I moved.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          prominent nasal sensation is the musty smell of decay, unless you're 
          in a crowd. Then it's an earthy body odor. More sweat. The soggy dampness 
          permeates everything. Clothes are ever wet. Even the plants seem to 
          sweat. The boardwalks sway with rot. For that matter, so does the entire 
          village. The pervasive color is green, dozens of hues of mildew and 
          jungle, so it's anything but monotonous. There's even a subtle beauty, 
          but it can be hard to see without a breeze- or better yet, air conditioning. 
          What a wimp!</font></p>
