        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">So what 
          does the future hold for the Gulf states after Deep Water Horizon? Is 
          full recovery possible? The answer would seem to be yes, though it will 
          be a slow, painful process. The road to recovery may be glimpsed, perhaps, 
          by looking at Ixtoc, in the Gulf of Campeche off the coast of Mexico, 
          the second largest spill in history at four million barrels. This took 
          place in 1979.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Local 
          reefs around Veracruz are still showing effects. On the lagoon side 
          the reef is still gray and dead, and the sea floor is lithified (turned 
          into stone) oil, like some new form of sedimentary rock. On the ocean 
          side it's a different story. There wave energy, oxygen, sunlight, and 
          the Gulf's oil digesting bacteria cleared most visible evidence of the 
          spill in a comparatively short time, years, not decades. The lesson 
          for the Gulf states, and the world, is fairly clear. When oil is entrapped 
          in low oxygen sediments, as in a quiet lagoon, it can hang around indefiniitely. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Even in 
          the turbulent, highly oxygenated waters off the coast of France, it 
          took seven years for the marine life and oyster farms of Brittany to 
          recover after the 1978 Amoco Cadiz spill. In Mexico the recovery was 
          much more painful. Ixtoc devastated local fisheries. Populations of 
          fish, shrimp, conch, and oysters were completely wiped out. In a split 
          second fishermen were unemployed, indefinitely, their future unknown. 
          Most gave up and found new work after being hungry long enough. For 
          many of them a long legacy of fishing came to a sad end. What about 
          the few who stuck it out? It was 20 years before catches returned to 
          normal. (next photo)</font></p>
