        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Today's 
          <font face="Georgia">visitor to the Canadian Rockies is on a vision 
          quest of sorts, like our native brethren of the past who lived and worshipped 
          in these hills. These mountains help restore the beleaguered souls of 
          a world overwhelmed by non-stop commotion, crowds, and bad news. To 
          hike the shores of Lake Louise or scale the granite heights of Mt. Robson 
          is to feel the peace and hear the quiet of a different world, more in 
          tune with our past.</font></font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">On my last evening in 
          Canada I hike the shore and stare at the last light of a summer sunset 
          on Mt. Rundle, &quot;Mona Lisa of the Mountains,&quot; as she reflects 
          in Vermillion Lake below. Nearby a beaver stirs from its lodge and coyotes 
          begin their solitary hunt. The world seems right again with calls of 
          the wild- bull elk bugling in a high meadow, the plaintive call of a 
          loon on the lake, and even the faraway howl of a lone wolf. These sights 
          and sounds yet resonate with the primeval ocean blood that swells our 
          veins. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia">Just a hop, skip, and 
          jump away is Banff, the largest &quot;park&quot; town in the world. 
          Looming over the town is the baroque Banff Springs Hotel, which helped 
          transform a railroad whistle-stop into a world-class resort. A short 
          distance from the hotel is Banff Avenue which on summer evenings becomes 
          positively citified, with flashing neon, happy hour, and karaoke having 
          replaced the campfire singalongs of yesterday. Critics of this scene 
          say the business community would turn these hills into a Canadian version 
          of Gatlinburg, in the Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee, and are determined 
          that this will not happen. With 30,000 visitors every hot July day it 
          may be too late. </font></p>
