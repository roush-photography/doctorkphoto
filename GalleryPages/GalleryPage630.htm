        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
          can only speculate. During the history of man there has not been an 
          overland route to Australia, this much we know. Therefore humans arrived 
          by sea. The world was very different 60,000 years ago, locked in the 
          grip of the Pleistocene when much of North America, Europe, and Asia 
          were covered with glaciers up to two miles thick. There was so much 
          sequestered ice that sea levels were 400 feet lower than today. The 
          result was Indonesia connected to Asia, probably as far south as today's 
          island of Timor, at the time only 50 miles from Australia. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          say <em>only</em> 50 miles. Think back to prehistoric times-the first 
          Eurasians migrating slowly southward to the tip of Timor. Imagine that 
          first vision of the vast and moody sea and the myths and superstitions 
          which inevitably sprang up around it. Then consider that even in the 
          relatively enlightened time of Columbus, only 500 years ago, sailors 
          were afraid to sail out of sight of land for fear of sea monsters and 
          falling off the edge of the earth, among other things. And they had 
          seaworthy vessels and 3000 years of sailing history in their blood by 
          then. But a primitive campsite in a remote corner of Kakadu National 
          Park confirms that in some mysterious manner the peopling of Australia 
          began at least 60,000 years ago, 57,000 years <em>before there is any 
          evidence of maritime travel, anywhere in the world</em>! In the ensuing 
          interval the glaciers melted, raising sea levels and submerging the 
          landing beaches, and any archaeological evidence that might have told 
          the story. (next photo)</font></p>
