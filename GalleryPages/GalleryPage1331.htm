        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          Dust Bowl changed everything about farming and life on the Great Plains. 
          Both the Canadian and U.S. governments became involved to help stabilize 
          the situation. The U.S. Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 initiated 
          a program of subsidies that is still in use. Farmers are payed not to 
          plant in order to protect the soil and to keep prices up. Their initial 
          resistance to this blatant &quot;government interference&quot; was short 
          lived. Today, a substantial portion of a farmer's income (or even all 
          of it), may come from subsidies in certain years.</font> </p>
      </div>
      <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The subsidy 
        programs and the establishment of national grasslands from federally purchased 
        tracts of prairie in the 1930s hinted at a new era of managed use. In 
        the 80 years hence there has not been another dust bowl. </font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">On the other 
        hand the massive reduction of plains biodiversity that began in the 1800s 
        has continued unabated. A recent long term study of breeding bird species 
        showed significant population declines in 24 of 28 species. The cause 
        was habitat loss from clearing even more land for farming. The removal 
        of trees and native grasses at the edges of fields and along highway corridors 
        also leaves less room for wildlife, a big factor in the recent collapse 
        of monarch butterfly populations. The damming and channelizing of rivers, 
        along with intensive use of fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides imperil 
        fish populations. </font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">During the 
        last century 39 prairie animal and plant species were listed as endangered. 
        This included the wolf and grizzly bear which had made a modest recovery 
        by moving to the fringes of the plains from the Rocky Mountains. Among 
        the listed birds are the piping plover, the peregrine falcon, and the 
        whooping crane. The causes are varied, but behind them all is habitat 
        loss-the conversion of a diverse prairie ecosystem into plowed fields 
        of corn and soybeans. </font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The plight 
        of the black-footed ferret is illustrative of ecosystem complexity. The 
        ferret has not been a target of man&#8217;s extermination programs, but 
        its main food source, the prairie dog, has been deliberately decimated. 
        In the early 1900s prairie dogs numbered about five billion. Today, because 
        of habitat loss and poisoning, the species occupies only about two percent 
        of its former range. As a consequence, the black-footed ferret is one 
        of the most endangered species in the world.</font></p>

      <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The greater 
        prairie chicken is doing well in the Sandhills of central Nebraska. The 
        lesser prairie chicken is struggling to maintain 
        a presence in other parts of the prairie because of habitat loss. </font><br>
