      <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">East 
        Africa is a nebulous term that ignores most things geographically east 
        about Africa, and refers instead to four countries, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, 
        and Rwanda. Despite the geographical confusion, one thing is clear, however. 
        This is classic Africa, the land of Hemingway, big game, and Kilimanjaro. 
        This is where the European presence in Africa began, 200 years ago, in 
        a quest for souls, ivory, and trophies. It is the latter that evolved 
        into the modern photographic safari. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Concepts 
        such as adventure travel and ecotourism were born, like us, in East Africa. 
        For most of us a big game safari is the essence of adventure, whether 
        in a Land Rover or in our dreams. The guide books for East Africa read 
        like a Who's Who of exotic destinations: the Serengeti Plains, the Masai 
        Mara, Ngorongoro Crater, and Samburu to name a few. The possibilities 
        for a &quot;dream come true&quot; experience are endless. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And 
        nowhere on earth are there more conservation issues for the modern day 
        <em>ecowarrior</em> to confront than in Africa, east or otherwise. Indeed 
        the plight of Africa's charismatic big game has done more than anything 
        to mobilize world opinion and action in the cause of endangered species. 
        Every Western pilgrim who journeys to Africa gives Africans one more reason 
        to protect their priceless wildlife heritage. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
        picture was taken from the veranda of my room at Ndutu Lodge in Tanzania's 
        Serengeti National Park. It is the classic African sunrise with an Acacia 
        tree in the foreground. Only the weaverbird and its nest are missing. 
        Perhaps the world's most iconic wildlife photography destination, the 
        Serengeti reveals a new look with each dawn. The excitement is palpable. 
        The sounds, the sights, the smells - everything about Africa - gets into 
        your blood. I will always return.</font></p>
