        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The environmental 
          movement is less than 60 years old but its roots date back to the late 
          19th century. The story begins with the fate of three species. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The year 
          2014 marks the centennial commemoration of the extraordinary extinction 
          of the passenger pigeon. For centuries the pigeon was believed to be 
          indestructible, the most abundant bird in North America, and probably 
          the world, with numbers estimated in the billions. And yet the species 
          was extinguished in a brief three decades by human exploitation. The 
          last documented pigeon in the wild was in 1900, in Ohio. Martha, the 
          sole surviving captive bird, lived an additional 14 years at the Cincinnati 
          zoo. On September 2nd, at the ripe old age of 17, she died, one of the 
          few extinctions ever to be witnessed as it happened. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But Martha 
          would not go quietly. This extinction would cause reverberations. She 
          and her kind would become a rallying cry for a budding new morality 
          in this country that believed it was just WRONG for man to indiscriminately 
          annihilate a species for fun and profit. The passenger pigeon became 
          a symbol of staggering abundance on the one hand and human greed and 
          callousness on the other. </font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The entire 
          coast of Oregon is &quot;green,&quot; that is protected as parks and 
          recreational areas. The belief that nature needs to be preserved rather 
          than exploited and &quot;conquered&quot; is a product of new thinking 
          in the 20th, or &quot;Century of Conservation.&quot; Learning to harvest 
          nature in a sustainable manner is one of the great challenges facing 
          mankind in the 21st century. (next photo)</font></p>
