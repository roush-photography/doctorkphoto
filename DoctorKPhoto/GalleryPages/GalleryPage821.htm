        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">So Martha 
          and her kind belonged to the ages. A victim of man and his unconscionable 
          greed? Perhaps. It's hard to say otherwise knowing the facts. But as 
          we shall see humankind at its worst can change. There is more to this 
          story.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia">We've all heard it before. Throughout 
          much of the 1800s the American bison was <em>shot</em> to near extinction. 
          I choose the word carefully as this was not hunting with a &quot;fair 
          chase&quot; or a noble purpose, but mass killing for profit and fun. 
          Often only the tongue was cut out to eat, the rest of the carcass left 
          to rot on the prairie. A thundering herd of 50 million bison was thought 
          to have been vanquished by the late 1800s. And then a small herd of 
          about a thousand was discovered in Yellowstone National Park. A reprieve?</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia">Less well known was a drama unfolding 
          in the southeast coastal wetlands of the U.S.. The snowy egret was suffering 
          a fate similar to the bison, being shot to smithereens, in this case 
          by plume hunters, from point blank range. And the reason? To provide 
          feathers, and even stuffed carcasses, to the fashion industry which 
          then made giant hats for the well-to-do in New York, Chicago, and elsewhere. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Georgia">The indiscriminate killing of bison, 
          pigeon, and egret would eventually generate a strong backlash of public 
          opinion. As the 19th century drew to a close, the free rein of these 
          &quot;hunters&quot; was about to change- they were being watched. A 
          conservation ethic was emerging in the nation, championed by powerful 
          forces. The &quot;big stick&quot; of President Teddy Roosevelt would 
          establish the National Wildlife Refuge system and set aside 230 million 
          acres of wild lands for protection. And a fledgling new organization, 
          destined to become the <em>National Audubon Society, </em>would serve 
          as a strong advocate for wildlife. Things were getting serious. (next
